# Laney Content Call 05 (Zoom Audio) (Voice Note AI) (Raw Transcript)

[00:00:02]
**Laney:**
Good morning, me. Good morning. Well, aren't you just. Or should I wait? Bright item, bushy tail this morning.

[00:00:11]
**Jody:**
Yeah.

[00:00:12]
**Laney:**
Did you get a haircut?

[00:00:13]
**Bradley:**
I did. Finally. So, been a long time coming, but yeah.

[00:00:20]
**Laney:**
You sure you don't want to come over and build a playhouse, huh? You want to just sit there at that desk all the time?

[00:00:25]
**Bradley:**
I mean, it's tempting, but.

[00:00:26]
**Laney:**
Yeah, we get it done in a week, man. Yeah, you just keep, you keep building your business. Hold on. You done, Joe?

[00:00:34]
**Jody:**
Yeah.

[00:00:35]
**Laney:**
Okay. Let me figure out how I'm going to set this up. Just a minute. Let me get a tripod.

[00:00:42]
**Jody:**
Hold on.

[00:00:42]
**Laney:**
This is Jody.

[00:00:44]
**Bradley:**
Hello.

[00:00:45]
**Jody:**
How are you?

[00:00:46]
**Bradley:**
How's it going? Good, good.

[00:00:51]
**Jody:**
She's looking for some equipment.

[00:00:53]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:01:04]
**Laney:**
Gosh. Okay. I know what I'll do.

[00:01:08]
**Jody:**
Okay.

[00:01:10]
**Laney:**
This is what I'm gonna do.

[00:01:11]
**Jody:**
Okay.

[00:01:17]
**Laney:**
And I'll come sit here in a minute. He's gonna go ahead and ask you questions.

[00:01:21]
**Jody:**
Go ahead and ask me some questions.

[00:01:25]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So I was just wondering what, like, what you guys want to go over, what the focus of this post was going to be, because I know you do. You do training, which is like a really broad topic. And I was wondering just if there's like, a specific aspect or angle of training, like a certain training skill or what you wanted to focus on for this particular post.

[00:01:48]
**Laney:**
It's the, it's the benefits of using fine and Dandy Aussie doodles training program. You know, it's the benefit of using us. You know, why would we, why do you want to train a brand new puppy? You know, because there's a lot of. So I guess what's good about the fine and dandy board and train program would be the title. And the other thing is, so, you know, it's not open to other dogs. It's only open to the dogs that we sell.

[00:02:23]
**Bradley:**
And you said it's called the board and training program.

[00:02:26]
**Laney:**
Yeah, because we're boarding them. We keep them here.

[00:02:30]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha.

[00:02:34]
**Laney:**
But the whole focus is kind of, a lot of people kind of know we train, but they don't. So this is the introductory as to. Oh, and they train, too. Do you know what I mean? Like, wow, they got a training program. They got a board and train. It's kind of like to introduce what we do, and then your questions, Jody will answer and you'll see why. I mean, there's 100 reasons to train a dog, but as far as our philosophies, what they are, and Jody will go through that. But I think, I mean, I don't want to put this in there. But just to get you an idea really quick, is the big training program in Nevada, Phoenix here is they use those collars that have the grab on to the neck. One, I think they're too aggressive for a small puppy. Two, you're not teaching the dog how to behave when he's not attached to you. The response to the dog is to pull here. But how do you get that dog to respond to you when he doesn't have that collar on? Do you know what I mean? So we've developed a program where this dog is learning how to react when he's not attached to you on a lead, and also how we want them to react on a lead, which is a different philosophy. You know, every kind of sticks to one thing. And so it's about attention span, and it's about the dog obeying off leash and the dog obeying on leash. So I think those are the three things. Attention, Spanish, on leash. Off leash. So that's kind of the thing. But I'm gonna let Jo, I'm gonna run the bathroom so you can ask her the question. The focus is really introducing what our program is.

[00:04:17]
**Bradley:**
Okay, gotcha. And is this program, is it like an extra thing that you guys charge for or do? Or, like, how does it, how does it work?

[00:04:28]
**Jody:**
We charge for it, and it's generally an eight week program. Six to an eight week program, depending on the dog. We don't even start them till they're ten weeks old because their attention Spaniel fan, like, they don't even know what you're saying to them, you know, to give them commands and stuff. But it also teaches them social behavior with, with humans. Right. So the whole time. So from the time they're born till the time they're with their mom is probably seven weeks. And then lane starts weaning them off of being a nursed. So from the time they're born to four weeks or 24/7 with their mom, once they start getting their teeth, like. So from four weeks to six weeks, we slowly take them away from their mom to play with their litter mates and then introduce their mom for feedings. Right. Because then they're eating food also. So they still haven't had a lot of socialization with humans. And then when seven to eight weeks, then they're pretty much weaned and they're eating and they're playing kind of with their litter mates, and then we wean their moms off, and then their moms kind of dry up, and then they're kind of with their litter mates and eating. So a lot of this is also introducing them.

[00:05:47]
**Laney:**
Are you recording this?

[00:05:49]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:05:50]
**Laney:**
Okay, good, because I didn't hear the recorder go off. I'm like, that's going to suck if you didn't record it.

[00:05:54]
**Jody:**
And so a lot of this kind of one on one with humans and teach them to be social with us. So then as a, so as we're working with them one on one, we're first of all teaching them, you know, we put them on a harness and we teach them how to walk, because a lot of them won't even walk with you. They're just like, what do you want me to do with this thing on me? So the first couple weeks is nothing but walking and then teaching them, you know, when we stop walking to sit. So they're being, so they're teaching. So they're learning a behavior, and the behavior goes with them in their home, because otherwise you have a puppy that's running around your house that won't listen to you, they won't come to you. They don't know their name. So if the people right away know they're, they're changing their name, we will start introducing the new name to them. So when they're getting this puppy, when they're, after they've been trained, the goal is they're going to be able to walk on a leash with them, be able to sit on command, stay on command. If they're here long enough and they're old enough, then we start teaching them a little bit off leash, and then we start introducing them to like to stay in your place. So whether it's your kennel, a dog bed, a blanket, whatever it is, in your home, you know, we teach them not to run out of a door when it's opened. So if you're opening your front door, we hope that the dog will not, you know, will stay and not run out, you know, get hit by a car or something.

[00:07:31]
**Laney:**
So real quick, Bradley, a couple things. A lot of the things we teach them, we can teach them, but if the client doesn't implement it at home and doesn't, doesn't follow through with what Jody has taught them, then all the training goes out the window, all of it. The other thing is, I don't want to type in a play by play of what we do. Because our program is very unique, and because we're with dogs, we understand the tendencies that most, that a lot of training services don't offer, such as, hey, that dog with the doors open, like I've seen a lot of training programs. I don't want this blog to be compared to, but I don't want to give up all of our things that we're doing and going, oh, that's a good idea. I want to do that. Oh, that's a good idea. I'm not here to offer other training services ideas, because there's training services and then there's breeders, and there's very little breeders and training that do the same thing. So a lot of training services. I'm going to teach your dog to do a, b, and c, but because we're with dogs, jody can pick up on things like, that dang dog just ran out the door. I'm going to correct that behavior because we are with them all the time, and because we're with them all the time, we can see things of behaviors where we go, you know what? I like this idea of training them not to run out the door. Let's start introducing that into our program. So as Jodie's doing this, she can pick up on things, and I think that's the better way. I want you to write it. We have the ability to pick up on behaviors because we're with these dogs from the day they're born and each.

[00:09:14]
**Jody:**
Dog has a different behavior.

[00:09:15]
**Laney:**
Yes. And so I don't want it to be, we do this, this, this, and this, because I don't want to give my whole syllabus to another trainer. You know what I'm saying?

[00:09:25]
**Bradley:**
Right. I mean, you might want to give, like, a basic outline of what you do, but you obviously go into every single detail.

[00:09:32]
**Jody:**
Yes.

[00:09:33]
**Laney:**
Yeah.

[00:09:34]
**Jody:**
Thank you.

[00:09:35]
**Bradley:**
I was gonna say so. So I guess, like, the main, main target audiences post is obviously someone who's considering getting a dog. Maybe they've already, like, pre. Pre ordered or pre whatever the word is.

[00:09:51]
**Jody:**
Yeah.

[00:09:52]
**Bradley:**
And is this something that people, like, have considered or are even aware of is like, okay, obviously they know there's a, there's dog training, but is it something that they've ever thought, like, you gotta ask this, like, is that something that people are aware of is some sort of training program that happens before.

[00:10:13]
**Laney:**
They even much as we want, that's why we're doing this.

[00:10:16]
**Jody:**
Yeah. And plus, I don't think a lot of people realize. They think that, oh, a dog is just gonna walk automatically next to you, and that's not the case once you put a leash on them and a harness on them, that doesn't guarantee they're going to walk next to you. So if you have an older person, sometimes they lose their patience where they're just like, oh, my gosh, I thought I would just be able to start walking with this dog, and this dog won't even walk.

[00:10:42]
**Laney:**
To answer your question, Bradley is, no, not everybody knows about it. And so Jodi and I have talked about it, and what we're doing is we're doing the blog. I need to make a webpage. I don't even have a web page on training. I just, I lightly mentioned it in my website. And I would pick up a training here and a training there, and I would train a few dogs when I could. But now that we're doing it full time and we have a full time trainer, I need to amp it up. I need to, we need to do more training, training, advertising, blogs. We need to do a lot more things so that we can increase the thing that our. So to ask your question is, no, not everybody knows about it. And this is why we are going to do exactly what we're doing with you today. So that to answer that question and then the other thing is to do with that, it'll come to me. Hold on. Yeah, we got to spend some money to make some money, basically. But the other thing, and I'm going to say, because Jody may not, I, it's not even a big deal. Sometimes on rare cases, we will allow a dog that's been purchased from us to come back and be trained. Usually we train the dog before it goes home, and a lot of people say, well, can we just bring him back and get him trained? And that's something her and I need to talk about because I don't mind if the dogs come back, but when I do bring a dog back, I'm at risk of introducing diseases into my kennel. So I'll have Jody talk about that. But in rare instances, we will allow some dogs to come back and be trained or retrained, depending on the health standard of the dog. Does that make sense?

[00:12:39]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. I'm surprised that people are just like, hey, can I ship them back to you real quick?

[00:12:44]
**Laney:**
They have, they have.

[00:12:48]
**Jody:**
The only thing is we don't know what bad habits they've picked up. And then once you've kind of socialized a dog to a home, sometimes it's hard for them to come back, even though we are phenomenal, and I tell this to Lainey all the time, we are phenomenal. But we're not a home setting either. So once they go, come back, they don't stay in Lainey's house. They have to go back to the Barna. They have to stay in kennels. So if they remove them from kennels, then. Then they have.

[00:13:17]
**Laney:**
Well, they don't stay in kennels all day. They have to sleep at night in the kennels. Right.

[00:13:21]
**Jody:**
So they're outside playing all day, or they're inside, and when they're inside, they're in kennels. So some dogs have a hard time adjusting back to that because they want to be able to come in and out to a house at their freedom, like. Like they were at home. And that is not the case. So sometimes I. Sometimes some of the dogs do not adjust back to the old setting.

[00:13:46]
**Laney:**
Yeah. Like, we had a lady who I said, if you're going to bring the dog back, because she wanted to bring the dog home and bond with him and then bring him back two months later, but she had to agree to keep that dog crate trained and to a few other things. So we offer it. But it's on a case by case thing. We usually train the puppies and they basically go home at four months, is that right? Eight weeks and another eight weeks. Yeah. But we will allow it on a case by case. So that does need to be mentioned. But I think what Jodi just said is a perfect example why we do it on a case by case. I think it's really important. I think when you pull out a dog that's so used to a home and you all of a sudden take them to a training program, it's traumatic. And the only good thing about our dogs coming back is they know us and they know the dogs around them, and they know the environment, so it's not as traumatic. But if there have been bad habits, we have to. It makes it harder for us to do our job. So we have to make sure.

[00:14:50]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:14:52]
**Laney:**
I have to leave the room for a minute, but I have a quick question, off topic. Did you ever change the repeats on the blog where the AI kind of kept saying the same thing?

[00:15:02]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I changed all that.

[00:15:04]
**Laney:**
Arlo was a little out of control on that. You're gonna have to talk to me about that. Okay.

[00:15:10]
**Bradley:**
All right. Yeah, I think there might have been two. Two repeats of the phrases, but, yeah, we changed them.

[00:15:16]
**Laney:**
Okay, cool. You and Jodi take over. She's awesome. So. But that, I think case by case, and I think exactly what she's saying makes a very good point.

[00:15:26]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. So I just wrote down some basic questions here. I don't know if you can see my screen.

[00:15:33]
**Jody:**
I can see you. Oh, your screen. Oh, that is way full.

[00:15:39]
**Laney:**
What?

[00:15:41]
**Jody:**
Okay. All right.

[00:15:43]
**Bradley:**
It's okay. I can just read the questions to you. If not, I didn't know if you are.

[00:15:46]
**Laney:**
Okay, let's see.

[00:15:48]
**Jody:**
Okay, questions. Are people aware of this? Not everyone is aware of it. Lainey will make them aware of it when she's talking to them and interviewing them on a purchase of a puppy.

[00:15:59]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:15:59]
**Jody:**
She'll say, like, what we have to offer, and then she says, we have a training program. Then some people will ask her questions about it. And then some people just don't want to wait. They want their puppy, and they have to delay getting their puppy by at least eight more weeks, which, you know, and then you have to think, where are they located? Because in eight weeks, that puppy is going to grow and won't be able to fly anymore. They won't fit in the carrier, the airline carrier. So the people that kind of decide that have to be able to transport by car, so.

[00:16:35]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha.

[00:16:36]
**Jody:**
Yeah.

[00:16:38]
**Bradley:**
So I'm just switching to the order of these questions a little bit to make it a little, like, it makes sense. So. Okay, so that's something that kind of, like, when you people do a puppy application or whatever, that's something that you do educate them on, then, um, yeah.

[00:16:51]
**Jody:**
That'S when she does it. When. When she's vetting the people and asking them, like, their personal life, how old are they? Blah, blah, blah. What do they do? If they work and all that kind of stuff, that's when she'll introduce the fact that we do a training program.

[00:17:05]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha. Okay. And is that, like, somebody can enroll in that at the same time there?

[00:17:10]
**Jody:**
Yes, most people do enroll in it. Right. Right away.

[00:17:13]
**Bradley:**
Right away. Right after that. Okay. And. And what does that look like?

[00:17:17]
**Jody:**
Let me see.

[00:17:22]
**Bradley:**
Well, so what does that look like cost wise? So in terms of, like, how much?

[00:17:26]
**Jody:**
It's $2,000. It's $2,000 for the training program.

[00:17:29]
**Bradley:**
Okay. And is it something that they, like, pay all upfront or.

[00:17:35]
**Jody:**
No, they pay on completion of training. And that training money goes to me. It does not go to Laneyen.

[00:17:40]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:17:41]
**Jody:**
So it's two separate entities. So if she gets a dog, she'll say, hey, I sold so and so, and he's going into the training program. So depending on how old the dog is, is when I will start the training program, and then that is, like, two total separate entities. Like, so they don't pay for it until they pick the dog up. We've had two people that have lived nearby, and they have come, and I have done some training with them so that they know what to do with their dogs when they get them home. And then always on pickup, we go through the entire training program, what they've learned, their commands, how to handle them and that kind of stuff, and then they pay me directly.

[00:18:27]
**Bradley:**
Okay, gotcha.

[00:18:29]
**Jody:**
That's the other. Your second question is, how does somebody enroll in the dog in this? Just.

[00:18:34]
**Bradley:**
I asked, though. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. So on the puppy application, and then. Okay, so it's two grand they pay you after the eight weeks? Yeah, whenever it's complete and.

[00:18:46]
**Jody:**
Yep.

[00:18:47]
**Bradley:**
So when does this training take place? I know it happens usually before they pick their dog up, but.

[00:18:53]
**Jody:**
Yeah, it's before they pick their dog up. And we do not start a dog until ten weeks of age.

[00:18:58]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Gotcha.

[00:19:02]
**Jody:**
It depends. I might take a dog out at eight weeks and see, you know what I mean? Like, I've had some dogs that were super, super smart, and they have picked up, like, immediately. You know what I mean? So where. I'll start training with them a little bit, you know, but they have to have the attention span to be able to train. So, like, some of the training. So she used to offer a discounted training where it was like a four week or six week and not do what we call box training. And I told her, I said, that has to stop because I'm actually giving my time away because in order for them to learn how to stay out, like, if I'm walking them and I stop walking and they sit for me and I'll put them on a stay, in order for me, for them to understand what stay means, I have to start them box training. Box training. I'll put them on. We have cots or, like, a little small box, and I'll tell them, get in your place. And the goal is to keep them in there for 30 minutes or on there for 30 minutes. And it's not a punishment. Like, I give them bones, I give them toys, I give them balls. You know what I mean? I create distractions as they go, as they're getting older. Distractions. Like, I'll roll a ball, I'll tease them where they want it, they want to get off, and I'll be like, nope, nope, stay in your place. So it teaches them a lot of different stuff. So it'll be like, say your doorbell rings, you can say to your dog, get in your place. And they should run to whatever their place is, however you've taught them in the home, and they should stay there until you tell them, okay, come or come off your place. So it teaches them a lot of different stuff. If you have company or if you have people that really are not fond of dogs, you can tell them getting your place and they should stay there, and you can give them their toys, their babies, their whatever, you know. So it's not a punishment. Like, we reward them. We're like, you're such a good boy staying in your place. And I'll give them a treat. And our treats are just our kibble. It's food. It's dog food. I don't use special treats or anything nice. So, yeah, it's. So it's like, rewarding them. Like, you're such a good boy staying in your place. You know what I mean? We'll have a dog walk by, and they'll be like, hey, I want to go hang out with that dog. It's like, no, no, no. I have you in your place. You need to stay in your place. So once I start box training them in a. In conjunction with the leash and outside training, um, then they kind of pick up on the stay right away. Like, stay, and I'll drop the leash, and I'll put them on a stay, and then I'll step. Maybe the. The beginning is, like, 1ft away. That means then, I mean, it starts that small. Like, I'll take one step, and it's like, okay, come to me. And they literally can just stand up at that point, you know what I mean?

[00:21:54]
**Bradley:**
Right?

[00:21:54]
**Jody:**
And then it goes to two steps, three steps. After a while, by the end of their training, I could take them off, like, drop their leash and go 25 steps away from them and make them stay there for a minute. And then when I come call them to come, then they should come right to me. So it's called a recall. And then as you learn, you know, with the dogs. And that's why, like, with me being around the dogs all the time, like, I can pick up on their. On their personalities. So I'm actually training two dogs right now on my own just because I don't have a dog to train right now. And I noticed that the. All right, so when someone comes to look at a puppy, you've got some dogs that. That don't care about being with a human and the other dog, and they'll be like, I just want to hang with my pack. So what's happening is they're not getting picked. So say you came to pick up a puppy or pick out a puppy. You're going to sit down on the floor. We're going to let the puppies come in and you're going to want the dog that gravitates towards you, that wants to sit in your lap, that wants to be by you. You're not going to go, oh, well, look at that little wallflower over there. He could care less than I'm not here. You know what I mean? And then you're not going to pick him. So as I'm with the dogs and they're older, I will start noticing, like, year of wallflower, you want to be with the pack. So now I'll start bringing them in, and I make them my barn dog. Sometimes Lainey gets mad, but I'll make them my barn dog for the day. And she's like, what are you doing? And I'm like, I'm introducing them to be with me. You know what I mean? Like, come hang with me. You know, come do this with me and I'll talk to them because they all know their names now. I'll say, come on, Iris, come hang with me. Help me do my barn chores. What are you doing, Iris? Let's check out that kennel. Check out that kennel. Come here, come here. Whatever. And then what happens is it teaches them when people come to look at them, they're like, oh, it's a human, okay? I wanna be by that human, which, if I don't do that, they never get picked. So there's a lot of different things that I kinda do. Or I'll say, you know, like she said, you know, I noticed one is like, so one I started training, and it was like, he listened great. When I had him outside, brought him in the barn, and he's just like, yeah, well, I'm not outside, so I'm not going to listen to you. And I'm like, oh, wait, this is not going to go right, because once you're in a home setting, that's when I, that's when, personally, I want my dogs to listen to me. If I tell them, go lay down or no, or go over, you know, get in your place or whatever, that's when I want them to listen to me. Or come over here, you know, in fact, a lot of times I've taught my dogs to start, not hand signals, but I, I'll tell my dogs to come here. Like, I'll use my finger, like, you know, how you're doing, like with a kid or something, like, come here. Because I always think what happens if you're in a situation where you can't, like, really be verbal to them? And I know this is like, off the wall. I go crazy sometimes. But it's like, say someone broke in, and I want my dog to be silent, and, but I want them to come over by me. Like, I'll start telling them, like, with my fingers, like, come here. You know what I mean? And so I've started doing some of that with these dogs, too. I'll tell them. And so sometimes when I'm releasing them off their box, I'll start giving them a hand signal, like, with my finger, like, come here, you know?

[00:25:11]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha. And so I'm curious, too. So, like, what kind of, like, what is the basic training curriculum? Like, the outline, if you were to say, check. Like, if this is a book and you got chapters in a book, like, what are the main chapters? But then also, like, specifically how that translates to, like, a benefit when they're in a homesteading later. Because I know you mentioned box training, and I. And I would hear that, and I'd be like, okay, well, like, what the heck? What the heck is box training? Or, like, why does that matter to me? But then you'd say, I think that you said something like, when somebody rings the doorbell at your house and your dog wants to go, you know, rush to the door or whatever, you'll be able to tell them to stay, and they'll stay. So I guess just like, the training itself and how that, like, translates to real life understandable scenario that, like, makes sense in people's minds why we do.

[00:26:01]
**Jody:**
Box training or whatever, and that's why we do the box training. I need to do the box training so that they learn their commands to stay, and then also that they know that it's not a punishment. So it's like a fun time, you know, like, here, you want a bone? Here's your favorite toy. Here's a ball. You know what I mean? Whatever. Like, I don't tell them, stay. Get in your place and stay there. It's like, okay, you need to get in your place. You need to stay there. You're a good boy. You're doing great. You're in your place. That's a fun place. Here's a bone. Here's a whatever. You know, so that it's not a punishment. And that's when I tell the clients, don't think of this as a punishment. Like, if you're. If he does something bad and you punish him and tell him, get in your place. Like, no, no, that is totally opposite of what we're training them to do. You know, it is a place where they feel safe, whether it's a kennel whether it's, like I said, some people untrained their dogs from kennels, so then it might be. And if they don't do a cot or a box, they'll use a dog bed, so. Or they'll use a blanket, like, get on your blanket or whatever. So as I'm training them, I start doing different stuff. So it's really. Each dog is kind of different, I can tell you. Like, I teach them to walk on a leash and sit. When I stop, I teach them to not bolt out of a door. I teach them to, you know, lay down, teach them to stay, teach them to heal, that kind of stuff. But then I'll start going into other directions sometimes, so. And that I find out more after I've contacted the client and say, okay, are you going to buy a cop for the dog? No. What are you going to use? I'm going to use a dog bed. So then I'll throw a dog bed down. You know what I mean? And I'll teach them. So I'll train them according to where they're going and kind of like the clients, you know, then I send them videos as I'm training them and that kind of stuff. If they're changing the name of their dog, I immediately start using the new name. So that. So if you don't have a dog that's trained, you kind of have a wild thing on your hands, right? Like, they don't know their name. They're not housebroken. They're very leery. So another thing that I started doing, I start taking them for rides in my car. Like, I'll tell Lainey, hey, I'm off property with this dog, because when you get a puppy home, well, you guys just recently got a puppy, right?

[00:28:29]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:28:29]
**Laney:**
Okay.

[00:28:30]
**Jody:**
So they're kind of scared because Lainey lives on seven acres in the country. Basically, there's no cars. No one comes to visit. They're only handled by Lainey, myself, and Sharon. So they're used to three of us. So, first of all, they're not used to Mendez, they're not used to cars. You know, they're not used to going in a car. They're not used to even actually coming in a house. So I'll start them, like, with. Sometimes with a doggy door. Like, Celine has a doggy door in the barn. So I'll start teaching them. If I tell. If the client says to me, well, we're going to have a doggy door installed. Not that they're fully trained in that. By the time they get them, but they've been introduced to it. So it's like, here's a doggy door. Because most dogs, they don't like that thing on their head going through. They're afraid of cars. So I'll start taking them for a car ride, a 15 minutes car ride, and I'm back, right? We'll bring them to the farmer's market to where we walk them. And, you know, they get used to other dogs. They get, I mean, they have a lot of dogs here, but they kind of know these dogs. Or I'll bring them home to my house for an hour and then bring them back. And they have other sense dogs on them, you know what I mean? Not the dogs that they're familiar with. So, like, your dog was probably skittish when you first brought them home. Like the loud noises, tvs. They don't have a tv. You know what I mean? So household stuff that we're like, oh, my gosh, it's so crazy. They're afraid of that or they're this or that. You know what I mean? Like, it's okay, you know, it's that kind of stuff that I'll start introducing slowly to them so that they're not so spastic and skittish when you get them home.

[00:30:11]
**Bradley:**
Right. And so I think you started covering on some of these, but I just wanted, one of the biggest question is what? I mean, what are the reasons why somebody would want this training program?

[00:30:22]
**Jody:**
Because it makes a calmer puppy and it makes the dog adjust much quicker and easier when you bring them home. It just makes them more well rounded. You know what I mean? It's like having a little child that you want to introduce them to this and that and everything. So when they get in social settings, they're not like, oh, they just become, I guess the dog becomes more confident in themselves and they're not afraid of everything.

[00:30:50]
**Bradley:**
Right? So if you were to describe that, and I know you talk about some of these already, but, like, real life scenarios, if you were to say, like, instead of this, there'll be that. So, like, instead of being, like, instead of being skittish, people come over, they'll be social. Or instead of being this, they'll be that. Like, what are some of those? Instead of this, they will be that kind of behaviors.

[00:31:16]
**Jody:**
So I don't know how you want to word it. That's your department. But, so if you introduce them into a car, they won't be afraid to get into a car. Do you know what I'm saying? Plus, it helps with their motion sickness, right? Because a lot of dogs will get car sick. So by us introducing them to a car and taking them for car rides, then they're less apt to be car sick. Not to say they're not going to be car sick, but they're less apt to be car sick. Bringing them to introduce them socially to the farmer's market, it introduces them to strange dogs. It introduces them to not to charge a dog, you know, like, hey, you know, like, you might get a real friendly dog and, you know, and that sometimes that's how a dog fight happens, you know? So by them learning how to be on a leash and on a, what we call a lead, people don't know what that means. So I use the word leash also by putting them on a leash and them knowing that they have to walk right next to your side and they can't, you know, go 10ft out in front of you, you know, they have to stay right by my feet. They can't fall behind me, and they can't go ahead of me. They have to stay right where my feet are. It teaches them, like, those are their boundaries, you know? Like, I can't go 10ft to the side. I can't lag behind, and she's pulling me. I can't go ahead and I'm walking her. No, I'm walking you. You're not walking me. You know what I mean? Picking stuff up when they're walking. Like, they'll pick a stuff up, and sometimes it's not. It's poisonous to them, you know? So when they're walking, like, if they want to pick up a stick, it's like, I'll tell them, leave it, leave it, leave it. Like, you can't pick. You can't do that. When. You know what I mean? So teaches them, like, lots of different stuff. Like. So I guess what it does is it makes their transition much easier when they go home, for one, they may know their name. They know a recall. They've learned. What's the word? I want? They've learned. Not their boundaries, but just like, you have a little baby, you have to teach them. No electrical outlets. No, don't touch. You know, don't do that. Don't do that. You're actually teaching them that so that when you get someone. So, like, you can't put this in your thing. And Lainey doesn't divulge it very much, but this is. These are notes for yourself, correct?

[00:33:55]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:33:55]
**Jody:**
Okay. So we sent a dog home to a client that never had a dog before. Their culture. Never had dogs. Their culture in their country was their dogs. Dogs ran rampant in their country. They didn't belong to anybody.

[00:34:12]
**Bradley:**
Or.

[00:34:13]
**Jody:**
Yes, yes.

[00:34:14]
**Bradley:**
I think she mentioned it offhand once before. Yeah.

[00:34:18]
**Jody:**
Had this poor dog for a week. Had no idea what she was doing with this dog. Ended up returning the dog. And the dog. Hazel's still here. I'm still now. I started training Hazel. So it's just like. And the reason I did is because. So a lot of people will get a dog, or they haven't had a dog in a long time, and this is so overwhelming that they think, oh, my gosh, I don't know why I did this. Right. I'm trying to house break. I'm trying to teach them their boundaries. I'm trying to teach them, don't do this, don't do that. Get in your kennel. This is when you eat. This is when you go out to poop. This is when you do. And it gets so overwhelming, I think, for some people, that they kind of throw their hands up and go, oh, why did I do this? You know? Right. So if you get a dog that's somewhat trained, a lot of that, it's like a very smooth transition. Unless you have someone like your mom or myself that is very much in tune to dogs that can. It's not. It's not. It's not an abundance of problems. It's like, okay, well, it's a puppy. You know what I mean? Like, we. Like, you wouldn't believe, like, some of the things we have to tell people, like, keep your dog in a laundry room. Like, don't give them free reign of the house. Like, keep them. And as. As they get older, you slowly expand their area till finally they have rain of your house. And they know, okay, this is, this. This is that. I'm not allowed. Some people have carpet upstairs in a two story, and they're not allowed up on carpet.

[00:35:51]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:35:52]
**Jody:**
It takes training. So. But if you get a dog that's been trained and knows, no, you can't do that, or you have to stay in your place. So that would be, like, a perfect example. You have a two story home. You have carpet. Indoor carpet upstairs. Right? Wall to wall carpet upstairs. You don't want the dog on the carpet. So now you tell them, no, you stay downstairs in your place. See, then they know, okay, I'm not allowed up there. You know what I mean? Or I'm only allowed up there supervised or only when I'm called to come up.

[00:36:23]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:36:25]
**Jody:**
So there's a lot of advantages to having them. Some people don't do it because of the price tag, but I spend eight to ten weeks with these dogs and it's on top of me helping Laney, you know what I mean? And sometimes it's an hour and a half a day. It's not a lot, but it's a half hour on training. Like lead training, definitely a half hour on box. And then sometimes if I add a car ride into there or if we do, you know, farmers markets and that kind of stuff, it, it just, I don't know, it adds up, you know what I mean? And a lot of people are like, well, I'm already spending 3000 on a dog and now that's another 2000. That's like 5000. But some people see the value and some people don't.

[00:37:12]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, but then I guess to help people see the value, I think it's good because, I mean, obviously you want to, like, present it as people can make the decision for themselves. But, like, how much? I guess time or energy or, or even, like, I'm say money, but, like, time or energy or effort, will this save people? You know, maybe each week or whatever that they have to. Yeah, down the drain doing this themselves. Because that, I think, is like, the value of is how much, like, how much time and energy and effort are you going to have to sink into this if you don't do the training program?

[00:37:46]
**Jody:**
Right. And like I said, some people aren't aware of it. So, like, the one dog that we did bring back for training and boarding, she was not trained. So she bought her. Okay. And her husband started walking her. Well, I guess they lived across the street from an equestrian park that wasn't their park. So he thought it was cool that the dog was like, oh, let me see the horses. So he'd let them off on her, like. Like let the leash really long. But that was such a danger because for one, she could have gotten hurt. For two, she could have spooked a horse with a rider on it. So now they had a hard time going. Well, every time she wants to go out, she runs with the horses. And they're not even her horses. So we're like, okay, well, that's kind of a problem. So when we brought her back for training, like, we had to teach her, like, no. You know, she wanted to run right away. And it's like, no, no, no, no. You know, so I told her, your husband can't walk him. Like, if he walks her, like, she has to be walked like this. So after, you know, four weeks she stayed for four weeks because she was older. Plus she had a destination wedding. There was a lot of different things going on that we agreed to it, but we told him, you know, like, this is, this is. These are the commands. These are her parameters of how she's walked. Like, as soon as you break that, they're like a little kid, they're gonna say, oh, well, okay. And it's interesting. Cause children behave differently with different parents. Just like dogs behave differently, right? So some dogs are just like, she lets me get away with murder, and I'm gonna do whatever, and then you have the next person coming. It's like, yeah, she's a little bit more strict. So I know I have to do this. I can't do that. You know what I mean? And dogs are smart. They. They pick up on that. They know, like, I'm really easy going with them. And now she's calling me the Pied Piper. She's like, why do they all follow you? And it's because I'm working with all of them on a different level. You know what I mean? It's like, okay, you can come with me. You do this. No, you're a fence runner, so I'm sorry you have to be with this one. You get along better with this one. You hang with that. You're with them long enough, you kind of start to see their personalities come out. And that's where I kind of start working with them, where it's just like, okay, this one needs a little bit more work on this one. This one needs a little bit here. You know, like, they all don't eat at the same pace, right? So right now we've got one guy, he's a really slow eater. And so all the other ones are done eating, and they're barking to go out. And. And, you know, and you could see now, I noticed he stopped eating all of his food. And I'm just like, simon, come on, buddy. I'm not going to let them all out until you're done. Come on, eat your food. So I would open his kennel and hand feed him a little bit, like. Like, entice him to say, come on, finish your food, and then you can go out. You know what I mean? But I noticed that he was. Couldn't eat as fast as the other ones, and then stopped when he's like, oh, they're all barking. We're going to go out. Okay, I'm not going to finish my food. But it's like, dude, you have to finish your food. Like, you're you're a baby. You have to eat.

[00:41:02]
**Bradley:**
And so, you know, what are some of the things that, because I know it sounds like there are some, like, universal kind of fundamental training things that you train dogs on no matter what. And then there are some things that maybe you customize to them when you know more.

[00:41:15]
**Jody:**
We do, and I think that's like.

[00:41:17]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, list those different things in those two different categories, like what is right.

[00:41:21]
**Jody:**
So when they're being, when they're being paid, when I'm being paid to train them, I'm more disciplined with them. It's like, okay, you have to come out and walk with me. You have to sit with me, you have to lay. Lay down, you have to stay. You're learning all your commands, right? And the dogs that aren't in that, and this is benefits Laney as a trainer, I mean, as a. As a breeder, all the people that comment are like, they're so calm. They're used to being handled because we. We do handle them a lot. Like, we pick them up, we cuddle them. One dog is afraid of storms. So when it was storms, it's like, come on, buddy, I'll hold you. You know what I mean? That kind of stuff. You don't find that with other breeders. You don't. They're just like, yeah, sorry, you're afraid of the lightning and thunder, but, like, I'm not going to pick you up and carry you and comfort you and make sure that you feel safe, you know, and that kind of stuff. And I think that's why I. She has such a repeat customer base, because all the dogs are cared for in a different way.

[00:42:30]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:42:31]
**Jody:**
You know? Um, but, like, as far as the paid training, they're learning above that, you know what I mean? So, like, if I know that a dog is sold, it's not going to the training program. Like, I don't spend my time teaching them to walk so that they can walk when they're leaving. You know, like, one lady just bought a dog and she was like, my next on the list to start walking. And, oh, my gosh, this dog wouldn't walk. We were dragging her and this was an older lady and it's like. And I says, the lady, see, that's why I'm starting to work with some of these guys, because it makes them more sellable as they're older, because we've got some dogs that are a year old that haven't been placed yet. You know, you don't want a year old dog that. That the only thing that our year old dogs, they're not housebroken, you know, and that's, like, a number one question. People will say, well, how many times do they go out to the bathroom? I don't know. They're out, and they're out in the field all day. I couldn't tell you how many times they pee and poop a day. I can tell you if they're dry in their kennels at night.

[00:43:35]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:43:36]
**Jody:**
I can tell you how much they're eating. I can tell you their personalities. You know what I mean? And that's why Laney vets them. Like, where are you taking them? So, like, our older dogs are all fence trained, which is. Which is a pro for when someone's buying them. So if you're moving on to land and you already have an underground fence, and we're telling you they're already fence, you know, trained, that's. Man, that's huge.

[00:44:05]
**Bradley:**
What is. What does that mean? Exactly? Again, the fence trained.

[00:44:07]
**Jody:**
So, like, lady has underground fencing all around her property. Right? So you have to teach them. Once we put their underground fence collar on them, they know that they.

[00:44:18]
**Bradley:**
Invisible fence kind of thing?

[00:44:19]
**Jody:**
Yes. Yep. So all of her older dogs that we've kept on property are all collar, underground fenced, invisible fence trained.

[00:44:28]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:44:28]
**Jody:**
So if someone's coming and buying them and they're moving to, moving them to ten acres and they have underground fencing, it's. It's huge. That the dog is under. Is already trained for that. Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:44:42]
**Bradley:**
What? So I'm just.

[00:44:47]
**Jody:**
Because otherwise, it takes time. So once you put the electric onto an underground fence, a dog doesn't know it's there. If you put the collar on and they pass the barrier, they're going to get warned, and then they're going to get shocked. So it takes time. So what we have to do with some of them, if we say, okay, this one wants to go play with the big dogs, but we can't put them out there because she lives on the river or wherever you're living. So what we have to do is it takes two of us. One. One puts the. We put the collar on them, and one. And, like, Laney will have them on a lead. We put flags up, visible flags, so that they know, like, that's your barrier. You know, once you come past those, like, your. Their collar will start going beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep until they're shocked. So now you have Lainey pulling them back. I'm telling them back, back. She's pulling them back. Telling them back so that they see the visible barrier. After a while, they learn, oh, it's beeping at me like, beep, beep. Oh, I can't go any farther. So it takes a while. Otherwise, they're. They're running crazy and they're getting shot because they don't know where to run to. Right. It's horrible to watch, you know what I mean? So it takes time to learn.

[00:46:02]
**Bradley:**
They're trying to learn that there's a boundary or a boundary line, and that kind of becomes more.

[00:46:06]
**Jody:**
Exactly. So that's something that she does with older dogs. But you don't pay for that, do you know what I mean? We just do it because they want to go out. Right, right. But so, like, the actual training program that you would be kind of introducing to would be, you know, your dog being able to walk on a leash, not bolt out the doors, stay in its place, go down on command, sit on command, stay on command. That's the kind of stuff that we teach them. And to be, you know, in the house with stairs, some dogs won't even do stairs because there's no stairs and it's all flat. So we'll bring them into a house. Like, I've got a basement. So sometimes I'll bring them over and kind of teach them. I'll try to teach them stairs if I have time. Do you know what I mean? So I wouldn't do that. If I'm bringing them to a house that there's no stairs.

[00:47:02]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:47:02]
**Jody:**
Right. You're in a two story. Did your dog know how to do stairs right away?

[00:47:07]
**Bradley:**
Um, I don't know. Like, we keep them downstairs, so I don't think.

[00:47:11]
**Jody:**
Yeah.

[00:47:12]
**Bradley:**
Issues going upstairs. I don't know.

[00:47:14]
**Jody:**
Right. So it's just stuff like that where, you know, that kind of stuff, but it just makes the dog, I think, um, more confident.

[00:47:26]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:47:27]
**Jody:**
I guess. More confident. I guess that's what you want. You want a dog that's not skittish and is afraid of stuff. It teaches them to be more confident.

[00:47:36]
**Bradley:**
That's. It's almost like going from. Instead of picking up your puppy as an infant with zero life skills, it's almost like a toddler maturity level.

[00:47:45]
**Jody:**
Yeah. Yeah. They've learned to listen. They've had to listen, you know, and you mentioned earlier.

[00:47:54]
**Bradley:**
So, like, what is it, an hour and a half ish a day kind of thing? You said, you mentioned it broke down almost like 30 minutes.

[00:48:00]
**Jody:**
It depends so, like, it depends. So if I have a dog that's healing really well and sitting very quickly for me, then I won't have to spend as much time on that. Then I'm going to move on to, I'm going to sit you. I'm going to teach you a doubt, you know, like, I want you to lay down. So when I tell you sit, you should sit. When I tell you down, you should lay down. Then I would, you know, it depends kind of on the dog. So, like, I'm working with the dog right now. He could heal. Sit, stay, put him on that box. And I turn my back on, and I'm doing something in the barn, and he's right off and he's like, hey, what are you doing? It's like, what are you doing? Get on your box. Get in your place. What are you doing?

[00:48:41]
**Bradley:**
The question is, yeah, one component of it is box training. Another one's almost like socialization when you're taking them in the car to the farmers market. So box training, socialization. And then was there one other, I thought there's one other thing you mentioned one kind of like.

[00:48:59]
**Jody:**
They learn. I mean, they're, I think they're just more confident. It builds their confidence.

[00:49:05]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha.

[00:49:06]
**Jody:**
Because they, I think they know what's expected of them. So if I'm going to go for a walk, I know what's expected of me. I have to walk next to her. I have to stop. When she stops walking, I have to sit. So you're walking and you meet someone and you start a conversation. You don't want the dog running and tearing and pulling you. Come on, let's go. We're walking. Once you stop walking, that dog should sit and stay in that place next to you until you start walking again. Whether it's a two second conversation, a 32nd conversation, a five minute conversation, that dog. So it teaches them what's expected of them.

[00:49:48]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha.

[00:49:49]
**Jody:**
And with that, I believe it teaches them the confidence. Like, I'm confident. I know what's expected of me. You know, where if you bring a dog in that's not trained, it's like, I don't know what you want from me. I don't know what s it means. I don't know my name. I don't know what outside is. I don't know. I don't want. I don't know what you want from me. So they're kind of running around, you know, crazy like, right. Cause because you're not sure what you want from them. So when they're trained, they kind of know, oh, oh, you want me to go out? Oh, you want me to sit down? Oh, you want me to, you know what I mean? Like, we'll teach them by teaching them to sit and know the word sit. So when you go to feed your dog, you can tell them at home which our dogs are fed in a kennel because otherwise you can't, they'd be eating each other's foods. Right. So, um, if they know the word sit on command, then what you could do, you know, when you, like, I make all my dogs sit when I'm putting their food down on the floor, it's like, sit down so that they're not charging the bowl and knocking it out of your hand and, you know, whatever. So I think basically, if I had to really pinpoint words, I would say a trained dog train at the training program, teaches them confidence and what they know you, what you expect from them, they know what you want.

[00:51:11]
**Bradley:**
Okay, gotcha. Sweet. Well, yeah, I think that's really good, a really good breakdown of everything. And I can obviously, like, all touch on the main points and then, you know, go, go in depth where I need to, but then also just keep it straightforward and clear on all that other stuff.

[00:51:29]
**Jody:**
Yeah, and then, like she said she doesn't want a lot of it divulge because a lot of it I started doing on my own. And she's like, where are you going? I go, I'm going for a car ride. Why are you making them sit at the door? So they don't bolt out. You know what I mean? Like, I used to have a dog that, man, it took everything I had for me. I couldn't talk to anybody at a door. I had to squeeze out the door and stand on my porch and talk to them because every time he would get out and then I'd be running, chasing this dog, and I'm like, oh, my gosh. Brought back, you know, just memories. And it's like, man, it'd be so nice to get a dog to say, to know that it cannot run out, you know, and that's kind of the stuff that she doesn't really want, like the whole secrets of exactly what we do. So that, so if you, if you did kind of like a broader thing saying we teach them, like households, I don't know how you want to put, how you want to word it, but teach them how to act in a home, I guess, you know, I don't know, whatever your words are. Yeah, you know, but, um. Yeah.

**Bradley:**
Have you guys ever thought of. This is just kind of like a side note, but have you guys ever thought of doing, like, half the money upfront and then half the money later, like, at the end of the training program? Or is that something that. No, it matters, you guys, or.

[00:52:48]
**Jody:**
No, because she wouldn't release the dogs. I don't. I don't think she would. If you signed up for a training program and I've trained them, I. Payment has to be made usually prior to pickup.

[00:53:02]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:53:02]
**Jody:**
Or with me, it's the day of pickup. Like, even when I deliver a dog, I have to make sure before I get off that plane. Usually make Elaine makes them pay the day prior, and all payments are made. Right. There was one where the lady couldn't get stuff to go through, and I'm like, deplaning in New York. And I, sister, did you get your payment yet? She goes, not yet. And I go, okay, what the hell do you want me to do? What do you want me to do here? And she says to me, if I don't have payment, she goes, you're not giving the dog. I said, okay. Okay.

[00:53:36]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:53:36]
**Jody:**
She goes, and they'll have to pay for you to fly back and fly back again. And I'm like, okay. So. But it came through in time, you know, because sometimes Venmo and Zelle has a limit. And when they start to do that, it's like, oh, my gosh. That was my daily limit. You know what I mean? So, yeah, payment. No, we don't really do, because they put a deposit down on the dog with Laney.

[00:53:59]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:54:01]
**Jody:**
So that's kind of the deposit.

[00:54:03]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:54:04]
**Jody:**
So, no, we don't require the training up front. It has to be paid in full on pickup. Okay.

[00:54:10]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha. Well, sweet. Well, yeah, I appreciate it. Appreciate it, Jody. And thanks for sharing everything and.

[00:00:00]
Just try it out one time and see what your history was. I can tell that I got sold her. Oh yeah. And she's like, I'm talking to her on the phone. She's vibing with me and she's kind of giving that green light. She's like, might as well. This is the truck's here. Take care of name, name, name. Taking a hundred dollars off. That's just 249 bucks. And that's for everything. And then I reit hot buttons twist. So it's like, cool. So it's 249. That's especially to get rid of the... Was that you guys still get up here. We'll take care of all that as well. Does that sound good? Question. Did you say like something that I do and I don't know when I say like first one. So first one, it's usually $349 just because we use more time. Does that make sense? Like, yeah. I go, but today because we're out taking this off, would you... Would you confirm to them? Me personally, I'll just look at them and I'll like not walk back. And then I go, max. Yeah, yeah. But sometimes I forget to do that. So I'm like... I don't say like cool product, right? But like, since my trucks are here, I'll say like alright. But it's like, I don't want to pause and ask a question because then they might be like, well, I don't know if we need it. And then so I haven't like roll out the discount even. And it's like, I'm not even... I don't have solve that foundations have been like alright or... Yeah, first one, you call me out doing 40 more dollars. It takes more time or product. Right? But like I said, my trucks are already here. And if we've done 57 Street 100 off. That's where everything especially get rid of wasps. You guys still get up high. And if you guys see bugs, we'll come out totally free. That's not good. Wait, what'd you say after the taking $100 off to make it 249? Just take $100 off. 249 bucks. And that's for like everything especially to get rid of like the wasps that you guys are still getting up high. And then if you guys see anything come up. Does that sound good? And now too, like, if I... If I think that, like, they're kind of on the fence and like, why do I want to roll out slicing at like 249, 149 as opposed to 199, 140. Because it's like I want to have like how often do they say yes the first time and if they do sick, I'm selling them 249, 149 and 279. 179 on... On Saturday. That was a... That was a huge house. We made sure that we included the basement. They knew they wanted it. And it's like, like, man, all of a sudden it's like that's a huge contract. As opposed just being like, oh, we're in the 170 process. I would buy either way. But like I'd done like everyone on the street. So like... And like the bandwagon like me makes it so just like other cool. Like everyone's doing it. Keep it with the jobs, whatever. But like the biggest thing is like they're just... A lot of times you just don't buy like... And if I want the quarterlies to seem small, how do I want the initial to look? Because if it's like cool, the first one's 249. And then... And then here also other wrong can do something. I do that quarter cross is 149. So it's super affordable. First 1, 2, 349, which takes more time working products since we're here to $800 also $249. And then the quarters are cut 149 and then you repeat the quarter. Why is that like a... No, no, you don't need to. And it makes it about price. And now they're adding numbers up in their head. In some ways I want to be really clear with the pricing. So yeah, quarterly we come out, they're just 1, 400 bucks. Super portable. First one gives you $349 just because it takes more like time work in the product. Some of my trucks are here though. We've done tons of your neighbors taking $100 off today. This is 249 bucks now I guess for everything inside, outside PC, bugs will come up. I want it to be like clear. That's really clear. But I almost want them to like be like, wait. So first one's this. There's 249 treatments. Now it's 2.91 and the quarter is going to get cheaper is 149 and you guys have two or three car garage. Then I move away from pricing and build value because in some ways I almost want it to be like they have to, like, think for a second to make sure, like, they're clear. Because then it's like their buying temperature stays hot as opposed to over explaining it and then having the buying temperature cool down, if that makes sense. So don't repeat the quarters again. You say the quarter, you say the typical initial, you discount it, you go to the hot buttons, and then you close. And now that I'm anchored high, it's like, I love... I love it when I, like, I know they're not gonna buy. And I'm just, like, deciding just to be ballsy. And I'm just like, here. I'm at 249, 149. I'm like, I know he's... I know he's gonna do the injection first. And I'm like, does that sound good? Like, I don't know. It seems like a lot of money. Am I gonna discount right away? No, never. On the first one. One ever. For the price. So then it's like, because now I'm like... I'm like, teasing it a little. I'm like, prolonging it a little. Like, anticipation is the best part. All right, big teaser. Then I go to the garage. Actually, before I even go to the garage, what am I going to do? Yes, I'm gonna dig my fingers in Caleb's shoes again. Caleb just bought shoes. Did me taking my fingers in your shoes yesterday have any influence over you pulling the trigger this morning? This morning. Can see people pulled the trigger and bought those shoes this morning.

[00:06:28]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:28]
So Al was like, did me pulling on them yesterday. Yeah, yeah. So then... Because... Are they gonna buy because I turn the garage? No. Unless, like, spiders are the big deal for them or unless they're like, pretty much sold already. So then it's like, first rack just touch. I'm not getting too great. It's like, oh, I traced on it. And then I go... Tell you what, we grabbed garage. Yeah, yeah. And then two cuz I can feel like maybe they're close. If I really want to just give them a little, like, smack, spank them the deal. And look, tell you what, let's just get this done. Our trucks are here. They make sense for me. 300 off do everything. Hurts me for the prices. 4 million bucks. And then 2 cuz, like, sales is very emotional. Sales is very emotional experience. Like, it's very, like, exciting guy comes to your door, and he's just like, hey, how's it going? What's going on? And then he's like, going this way, and he's like, building Value. He's like teasing you. He's teasing you like oh, you getting lost up here. Like we're going to take care of that. Oh yeah. And at the end you're like okay, how much is this going to be? This is this guy be crazy expensive. And then you go through it. Cool the corners. Just do it for this one. Okay. 149 first one like 249 put one. And then like... Like they're like... And then Al's like garage street add on. So if we can get it down. My emotions are so high right now. And then you're like... And then they're like I'm riding a hormonal roller coaster. And then you're like find our husband. I spider sex 13. Heck yeah, I am. Love it. She's not going to be on couch with cousin. Let's just get it done man to man. I take $100 off the first one she threw. Just give fun. We'll call you for. And the customer's like so but anyway he falls to the ground.

[00:08:57]
Heart attack.

[00:09:00]
It's like... It's like... It's like a 30 minute pic. Anyways, understand sales is emotional part of this too. Like there is like a little bit of like... Like a little you little... Because like I also like I don't want to be like overly explicit and overly clear. Like doing 18 month program, you have seven services. I'm gonna servicing today in June. Then your first quarter come back in 30 days. You're paying me again for that. Then it's every 80 to 90 days at the same price per service. You have a three day rider rescission. You can cancel for free. You can take one time service. You can cancel like I'm not gonna be... Oh they explicitly. That's no fun. That's the welcome... Welcome... That's the... They can be sterile. I'm not sterile. Okay. So going through this clearly Matt, just to recap because like I think a lot of times we all think we're doing this and then we're not. And then we don't get the results we want because we're not doing what we should. So cool. I do the same thing for everyone. I'm sure this makes sense. We should y 18 months. The reason being pretty easy. Are the adult bugs hard to get like the eggs and pup? Does that make sense? Yes. Awesome. So that's why we're coming out quarterly. We didn't do it that way. It just wouldn't work. Especially if they don't have a company. You gotta make that clear. If they do have a company and it's like active, they're cool. So we do the same thing as active. We should know them for 18 months. That way we can break down like all the ice staples. You probably see that in your fine because they already get... It's like if it's like a termite switch over. Like, I probably want to make that a little bit more clear because like they don't have contracts in terms they usually don't discount unless they sign for the door to work. So of course, cool. You get a degree, a 300 quarter. The price rise. Awesome. The core that we're coming out, just 149 bucks. Jump. No fluff here. Like how many square feet a month? Oh, your home is so sick. One thing is like we clarified too is like it gives you a lot more control not repeating like, okay, cool. So at home, anything 3,000 square feet is just this. And like most times I feel like right now is like cool if it's one thing and a quarter. Exactly. How many square feet are home? 2800. Awesome. So according out really just 149 bucks. Like super affordable. The first one, it's usually $349 just because it takes like way more time or product. Right. Since my trucks are here, we've done like a lot of neighbors taking literally $100 off. But 249 bucks for the entire first service. That's like, for everything, especially to get rid of like the loss because it's still getting up high. And then like I said, if you guys debug come up for free, that's not good. And then it's like, even if, like there's so many times where I'm pict when I like, I think or I know they're gonna give me an objection. I want to be here because it's like I can do the garage and then I can give them a big price drop. Like because at a big price shop, then it's like it gives them that kind of like nudge effect where it's like if I'm at anchored at 199, like 149, it's like I'll take 50 off and get this 149. It's still good. Like $50 is $50. But it's like if I want like, if it's like the white projection or whatever and I want to create more earth. So you do it now. It's like, look sa the trouble. Come back by my truck's here. Tim Best thing in the business. He's around the corner. Like, let's just get it done now. Your wife will love it. I'll literally do all the walls for you guys at high, all the cobwebs. And it'll take between us, if you don't home now, take one quarter. How do you tell... Cuz I... I know sometimes for me I'll... I've had it drop from $249 to $199. Do you ever have it where you just take $50 off? And if you do... But are you usually typically... Yeah, it's like... And maybe that could be something better. It's just kind of like it depends on how sold they are and like how price into... Because if they're like, if they're super close, then like I might even try to piece them with something else at the price. But if they're like, if I can tell, it's just like, they just feel like it's expensive. I want to get to their ballpark, but I want them to think they're getting... I want them to get the Tesla for the go price. Because if you anchor at like, you know, oh, like we'll do 9:50. And also first one is just 169 bucks and quarters are just one full hand. And it's like then where you go. Then you're taking $70 off the initial, so 99 initial. Then they're like, well, can't you do the quarter so 99 as well? You know what I do for 119. And then... Then you're selling a 575 contract and you could have sold it for Tyler. Okay. It's not... They don't buy it for the price. So questions about this or what... What have you in thinking about how you did pricing yesterday? What's different about like this that you want to keep? I think just... Just the anchoring higher at the... At the 259 or the 269. I... I can see a value in that. In... For me as a customer, if I'm a consumer and I'm like on the edge, I'm like, dude, I like it. The value is there. She's like a little...

[00:14:47]
Or I do want to talk to...

[00:14:49]
Her, do a little research, whatever. If it was an extra hundred dollars off and having that power, I feel like that's a lot. Sometimes I feel weak or dinky, you know, taking $40 off and it feels cheesy. Doing a drop like that versus a hundred dollars. It feels like that's that's a substantial drop. So take 27 tonight. I think it's super important to say like before we come out quarterly. We didn't do it that way. Yeah, yeah. And I was going to mention like one thing with the 249 yesterday I, I made a point yesterday. I was thinking for higher. So I started 249 with both the sales I had. I started it was 200 negative base. But like both of them have pitched been pitched by after moxy and they're like whoa, like that's way more expensive. And I was like yeah, well it's like way better. And like I feel like when I like was like confident like 239 I still had to drop it or anything for like they were just, it made sense. Like wait, what the heck? Like yes. This guy's like selling you product. It's not like 3:9. Yes. Or like whatever they were pitching. I'm sure. Cuz then too then they're like oh I'm getting 300... I'm getting $250 service for... Yeah. For me I that like something I noticed yesterday is like...

[00:16:29]
Oh yeah.

[00:16:30]
So for home. Yeah. Don't repeat quarterly garage of it. Team them, make them ask you again and then redirect to the garage to build value and close up. Okay, let's pair up. Practice this. And like you want to stay in here. See what this or have a picture. Like you don't have to say whatever I say but it's like the structure should be the same because like you're going to make sure you don't have issues with 18 months because you all have to be above 70%. And also like you're going to be able to anchor higher because it's simple. And I want this to be really simple and like relatively efficient because I'm trying to flush out the objections. And it's like if I'm talking forever they're going to interrupt you and shut you down. And then it's like you have me roll that price and they give me objections and I'm trying to anchor somewhere so then I can work from there. If you never anchor, then you can't negotiate. But being able to do this efficiently, 12 pour cost and 40 bucks, that's super affordable. First one usually $349. It takes a lot more time, more product. Right. But one my checks a year, we're done taking $100 off. So it's literally 249 bucks for literally everything. Especially like the loss you guys get... High. And if you ever see bugs in between come off. Does that sound good? And it sound good. Boom. I'm ready. Ready to go to war. Flush out the objections, retwist, happen, barrage, close, research, often discount, assume it. Boom. Okay, partner up. But do focus on do this pricing role play a lot. I'd say for now don't do like vacuum or anything. Like service or intro just so you can get this like really, like dialed. So we don't like... I don't want anyone wandering way to prevent us. And it's lay set. I'm gonna send it to the front. Cool. So as far as pricing goes.

[00:19:05]
Right out here.

[00:19:06]
I know. Let's see. I wrote down all that stuff. All right, Pricing. I'm going to read straight off this. I'm hardly going to look.

[00:19:21]
I don't want to learn it, just memorize it.

[00:19:22]
Yeah.

[00:19:23]
And...

[00:19:23]
And what was your name? This is Bradley. All right, Bradley. I said my name is Drake. Nice to meet you.

[00:19:29]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:19:30]
So we do the same thing for everyone out here, Bradley. I'm sure it'll make sense. We treat her for 18 months and the reason being is because it's easy to get the adult bugs in the first line, but it's harder to get the eggs when come back. That makes sense.

[00:19:41]
Yeah.

[00:19:41]
Yeah.

[00:19:42]
So cool. That's why we come out quarterly. And Bradley, do you know the square footage your home here?

[00:19:46]
Yeah, 2800.

[00:19:49]
Okay. Yeah. For a home your size, we're going to come out quarterly and it's just 149 bucks. So it's super affordable for everyone. And then on the initial... And initial, it's typically 349 because it takes more time, work and product. Since our trucks are out here and we're taking care of the kiffords and the clin out here, taking a hundred dollars off, making it 249. And especially, especially those walls that you're getting up here. I'm in the top. We're going to take care of those and so they don't keep coming back. And if you do see anything, then we'll come out for free and resurface the whole home. Does that sound good, Bradley?

[00:20:30]
Sure. Yeah.

[00:20:34]
That was really smooth. Definitely going to take some time to like get the muscle memory.

[00:20:40]
Yeah, it is good. I need it because that's a lot of times. Let me try at least free ball it and see and then you can correct me if I'm skipping anything. Be the first.

[00:21:02]
Are you just going to try to do some of yours and that one you can?

[00:21:05]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:21:06]
You just read straight off of it. You don't have to do icon.

[00:21:09]
Cool. So... So yeah, Drake. We do the same thing for everyone. We treat all the homes for period of 18 months.

[00:21:14]
Reason?

[00:21:15]
It's easy to get the adult books hard get paid. You buy a lot of rides. That make sense?

[00:21:19]
Oh yeah.

[00:21:19]
Cool. So that's why we come out quarterly. So for a home your size, do you remember how many square feet it is?

[00:21:26]
Yeah, about 3,000.

[00:21:27]
3,000. Okay. So quarterly for a home your size, we're coming out. It's just 167 bucks. That's it. Normally the initial is where it gets to be more expensive. Like if we're sending a truck out just for you guys, take more time, product, gas, everything. But since we're in the Richardsons and literally like 30 of the neighbors homes in the area and you're all on the same route, it's convenient. We're literally taking a hundred dollars off. So for this one, it's just 179. Sorry, it's just 279 or taking 100 off.

[00:22:01]
So it's...

[00:22:02]
It's just 279 and that's it.

[00:22:11]
Twist the hot buttons. Something that you pointed out for him. And It's... Yeah, it's just 279.

[00:22:16]
So... Yeah, it's just... It's just 279. And that's especially for like those wasps you guys were getting. So they don't come back. And then if you see anything at all in between, we'll come back 100%. So that's not fair. Yeah.

[00:22:31]
Yeah, that was pretty good. Do you ever get any, like, probably not, but I guess just keeping it simple right there, we started explaining a lot and that's kind of what I wanted to take back. Because when you start saying on the routes and gas and everything like that... Yeah. I feel like sometimes you may get some pushback there and it start make dipping a little bit. Just because you started... Because I'd ramble on about stuff like that.

[00:22:57]
I agree.

[00:22:57]
Because it should be. And sometimes you want to like explain it.

[00:22:59]
Right.

[00:23:00]
But just short phrase.

[00:23:02]
Yeah, that's what I was trying to put as well. Because I mean I'll just like go out full blast.

[00:23:09]
You're like giving the like in a paragraph.

[00:23:11]
Right. And I just don't need to do that.

[00:23:13]
Yeah, I agree.

[00:23:15]
I do that a lot.

[00:23:16]
So... But like since... Yeah. Since we're already 57 of the neighbors in the area and the trucks... And the trucks are already here.

[00:23:24]
Yeah. It's just this discount. Boom, boom. Hot buttons. Boom.

[00:23:28]
Yeah, especially does he go. So just 279. That's it. Especially for those wasps.

[00:23:33]
Yeah. And then, and then we can practice. Okay. I'm gonna practice a little bit of racking with this. Usually the racking is like so true. I usually go straight to garage. But if I'm pointing out walls, what the hell it is a garage, do you know?

[00:23:48]
Right.

[00:23:48]
So I'm gonna start going to like back patios or decks like ants walls and then garage and basements for spiders. Yeah. So, yeah. And we'll come out and resurface your home for completely free if you do see anything. Does that sound good, Bradley?

[00:24:03]
I'm not really sure, man.

[00:24:05]
Yeah. You know what, I'll tell you what, we're doing more for you. So I'm sure you have... You have a back deck or patio back here, right?

[00:24:12]
Yeah, it's like a patio.

[00:24:13]
Okay. Yeah. So usually around those, you know, you're getting the ants that you're seeing up here, the big black ones we talked about. Basically, it's usually a $50 add on value each time for this. And for those patios, the ants are going to nest up under it and colonize throughout. And other companies with spray, which really doesn't get to the root of the problem for us. We're going to lay down that granular around it to break down those egg cycles from right up underneath the patio. And we're going to do that for completely free every time we come out. Like I said, this is all included with all your high eats, your base treatments and yard treatments, those along with it. Does that sound fair?

[00:24:48]
I guess. I mean, prices sound a little bit...

[00:24:50]
Yeah, I mean you get what you pay for out here. I mean, look, I don't... Tell you what, I'll... I'll take another 50 off your initial. Make it just 199. So... Yeah, we'll go ahead and do that today. I one time had a dude. I was, I was, I was closing up with them and on pricing and he was easy lay down. And I was at like 149 with him.

[00:25:17]
Yeah.

[00:25:17]
But he was like, can you do 120 or 120? And I was like, okay, well, I know... I got him. And I was like, look, I can do 129.

[00:25:25]
It's like, yeah.

[00:25:26]
He's like, okay. Yeah. I was like, yes.

[00:25:28]
This one guy, this one guy I had, he was like, I don't know...

[00:25:33]
If I'll do it.

[00:25:34]
And I anchored him it's still high. Is like 1971 1, like 37 or something like that. And he's like as super persistent things...

[00:25:45]
Like if you can do it for...

[00:25:47]
First 400 bucks, I'll do it. And I was like, okay, we do 107. Keep the margins clean, that's fine. I was like, okay, don't even have...

[00:25:59]
To work for it.

[00:26:00]
He's like, all right, wife take care of this. Make sure it's not a dime over...

[00:26:03]
107 first take all taxing something. Oh, it one time. Yeah, yeah. And Bradley, we do the same thing for everyone out here. I'm sure it'll make sense for you. We come out over span of 18 months and do seven services. I mean, the reason being is because it's a lot easier to get the adult bugs, but it's a lot harder to come back and break down their egg cycles.

[00:26:26]
Right.

[00:26:27]
Does that make sense?

[00:26:28]
Yeah.

[00:26:28]
Okay, cool. That's why we come out quarterly. And Bradley, do you know the square footage of your home here?

[00:26:33]
Yeah, I think it's like 25.

[00:26:35]
Okay. Yeah. So what we do for you come out quarterly, it's just $149 for a home your size, so it's super affordable. Initially, the first treatment is more because it's more time, work and product.

[00:26:46]
Yeah.

[00:26:47]
But our trucks are in the neighborhood today taking care of some of your neighbors. So I can go ahead and take off our hundred dollars, making it just 249. And this is especially going to take care of these wall pests. You're still getting in these high heats.

[00:26:58]
Yeah.

[00:27:00]
And if you do keep on saying anything, we're going to come back and retreat home, which... Does that sound good?

[00:27:05]
Yes.

[00:27:18]
Thank you.

[00:27:27]
All right.

[00:27:28]
Yeah, that's getting a little bit.

[00:27:29]
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

[00:27:31]
We got one more time.

[00:27:33]
What's that?

[00:27:38]
Just the wording?

[00:27:39]
Yeah, it's just the wording.

[00:27:40]
It's like the, it's the same exact thing.

[00:27:42]
Steps. Yeah, yeah.

[00:27:43]
I, I, it's because that's good. Because usually in the pricing, like I don't really ask them. Does that make sense? I'm just like head nodding to them.

[00:27:52]
Right.

[00:27:52]
And just like I need to be affirming it. Yeah, yeah.

[00:27:57]
So same name. David. Yeah. So, David, I'm sure this will make sense for you just like everyone else.

[00:28:05]
Damn.

[00:28:06]
I'm just putting.

[00:28:07]
Okay. No, no, no, David, I'm sure this will make sense for you just like for everyone else. We treat all the homes for a period of 18 months. Reason being it's easy to get the adult bugs, hard to get the eggs, pupae, larvae. Does that make sense?

[00:28:17]
Yeah.

[00:28:18]
Cool. So that's why we come out quarterly. And then as far as pricing goes, do you know the worth footprint of your home?

[00:28:25]
It's about like 2000.

[00:28:27]
2000 per, same as everyone else. So for a home your size, quarterly, we're coming out. It's literally just 157 bucks. Super affordable. Normally, where pest control gets to be more pricey is on that initial service because there's more product time. Trucks come out to you. So normally that service, if you call us, we... $369. But where my trucks are here, and we've already done like 57 homes in the area. Everyone's on the same route, literally taking $100 off. So it's just $269. And that's it. Especially for those wasps that you guys were getting, those stinging wasp mud dobers and everything that I showed you on the bug. Okay.

[00:29:04]
Okay.

[00:29:04]
If you ever see anything in between, come back for free, just give us a call. That's up... Fair.

[00:29:10]
Yeah. I mean, I want to talk to my wife first or something.

[00:29:15]
I never met a woman who loves the bugs. Like, she'll be super happy and proud of you for... For getting it done. And takes a tor off your plate as well. I assume the wasp would be the main thing for her, right?

[00:29:25]
Yeah, I mean, she just doesn't like bugs.

[00:29:27]
Okay. I'll tell you what. You can tell your wife, twist my arm. You can make me a hero or sorry, not make yourself a hero. Trying to use the line, you tell your wife that you twisted my arm. What I'll do for you guys? Just since you're going to get a lot of spiders webs in the garage when my technician comes out on, that's a $50 add on to do all the detail work. Sweet treat. Get all those eggs out of there. But since we're already here, I'll throw that in for free and obviously get another 50 bucks off your initial. So it's just two... Trying to do the math too much. So it's just 219. That's better.

[00:30:04]
Yeah, let's do it.

[00:30:06]
Okay. Cool racks at the end.

[00:30:23]
You should... Did you go straight to a price drop?

[00:30:26]
Just skip the... I did kind of a combo like add on and then like a cheaper price drop.

[00:30:32]
All I really can remember is, see, doing the price drop, I... I feel like... But you people won't pay attention to the... To the add on if you're just Talking about the price drop, you know just cuz you're like oh just drop. Like I, I feel like constantly closing is a good thing. You know like doing an add on and then doing something close. It just depends how you're out. Like if they're still like pushing back I do a price drop them and like make it a no brainer for them. Yeah, I would probably try to close them like five, six times before... Like okay, just throw out a six.

[00:31:10]
Just do it.

[00:31:11]
Just be like all right, let's do it. Like I'm, I'm not gonna be se like 69, 119. Like that is so cheap. Like this is a super no brainer for you. It was like I don't want to lose them. If I've lost all my ammo, I'm just going to throw it out.

[00:31:24]
Yeah.

[00:31:28]
Okay.

[00:31:29]
I wonder too dude. So like this, this is kind of an experimental thing but like I had a guy where he obviously had ants. This was the pre resolved sale that he didn't have any a projections and instead of so like he had ants that are obvious I could see him gave her padded everything I said I was like yeah. So normally most companies don't do this. We treat the yard as actually normally an add on but in the group... Right.

[00:31:54]
We'll do it for you.

[00:31:55]
Like we're literally going to come out for these ants. We're going to granny like six feet from the base of the home, treat them, take care of the source. And so I made the grain... It was like an add on service that he was getting for free and like an add on to a hot button.

[00:32:06]
I think that's good and it may get some people but I feel like our prices are already more expensive than some people. Like if they're using terminates or something. So like I already go ahead and do that as part of the service because if they give me a price objection I'm like well you're getting what you pay for. Like we're able to take care of just not only your base but we're doing the hyes and yard along with it. So I mean like I said you're just getting way more for the value of your money. And usually with objections with people who have companies like that, they're like we're good. And I was like well out here I could totally get it. Bunch of people weren't interested at first but we're doing a lot more in a way good service. You know what I mean by that? And then once I go through it, I'M still going to get some push back at the end. So I'll go back to it and be like, look, I told you we were doing more. So tell you what. And I'll, I'll go to a rack of whatever that suits them. So I feel like that kind of helps them out a little bit more. I don't know. But I feel like, I don't know, 80 pound canis.

[00:33:03]
Yeah.

[00:33:04]
Situational, maybe if they're a hard... I would say Indian people, like hustlers. I would, I would say usually this to add on and let them know that he's getting it for free.

[00:33:16]
Yeah.

[00:33:17]
Stuff like that.

[00:33:17]
I'd probably do that.

[00:33:19]
Yeah.

[00:33:25]
Yeah. Because I probably would have had a deal the other day with one guy doing that that would have made sense because he was like, Well, I was at 69119 already. He's like 99. I can pay 99 with Termin X and we'll get it done. I'm like, look, you're getting a lot more than what you pay for. You're getting better value for your money.

[00:33:41]
Yeah.

[00:33:42]
So I mean, this is what I got. Like, I'll tell you what. And I'd do it add on with them, but it just like wasn't enough. Right.

[00:33:50]
All right. Yeah.

[00:33:52]
Anyways, yeah, Bradley. Basically. Yeah. Bradley, as far as pricing goes, we do the same thing for everyone out here. We do treatments over a span of 18 months for seven treatments. You get two full summers out of us. Does that make sense?

[00:34:09]
Yeah.

[00:34:09]
Okay. And the reason being we do this is because it's a lot easier to get the adult bugs when we come out, but a lot harder to break down those egg cycles. You think? Does that make sense?

[00:34:21]
Yes. Cool.

[00:34:22]
And that's why we come out quarterly. And do you know the square footage of your home here?

[00:34:26]
It's like 32.

[00:34:29]
Yeah. For you, we come out quarterly every three months and it's just 149. So it's super affordable for everyone.

[00:34:34]
Yeah.

[00:34:35]
And typically the initial is more expensive because it's a lot more time work and product to break down those egg cycles and Fairmont trails. But our trucks are out here today taking care of your neighbors. So we're taking a huge $100 off, making it just 249. And especially we're taking care of all these wasp nests you get up here. No one wants to deal with those. And if you do see anything between treatments, you can call us and we'll come out and resurface your home for completely free. Does that Sound good?

[00:35:00]
Yeah. Do you want me to do or... No, I think that's good. I think that's good.

[00:35:06]
Yeah. I mean that's like, that's super solid.

[00:35:08]
I think that's good.

[00:35:09]
It's like, that's a lot of pre resolving in that.

[00:35:13]
Yeah.

[00:35:13]
Of anything. Of like, oh, can I skip treatments and do it next summer? Like, no, this is what we do.

[00:35:19]
Yeah. Let me try one more time. I'm gonna throw in one pre resolve that I've used in the past for carbon pamphlets and just...

[00:35:26]
That would probably be good for me.

[00:35:27]
It's actually like, it's super effective. I just want to see if it's too...

[00:35:31]
I don't know if, if pre resolving for cards and pamphlets. Like, I feel the biggest thing is like Alex said, it's like just keep on saying good day.

[00:35:38]
Yeah.

[00:35:38]
And when we come out, shoot your home today.

[00:35:40]
Like, yeah, I think that's you too. Let me, let me see what you think of this too to like just add more to it. But okay. So yeah, Drake, I'm sure this will make sense for you guys. We do the same thing for everyone here. We treat all the homes for a period of just 18 months. Reason being it's easy to get the adult bugs harder with eggs, pupae, larvae. Does that make sense?

[00:36:02]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:02]
Perfect.

[00:36:03]
So yeah, that's why we come out quarterly and then quarterly your home, did you say was how many square feet?

[00:36:10]
About 2500.

[00:36:11]
2500. Cool. So for a home your size, quarterly, everyone's paying 157 bucks. That's it. Super affordable. Normally where pest control gets to be damaged, you have the parking shoot all the neighbors homes for 18 months easy. Get the dope bugs hard to do the eggs. People buy larvaes. That makes sense.

[00:36:27]
Cents.

[00:36:28]
Cool. So your home, 2500 square feet. And just so you know, so for the group rate, we're not doing cards and pamphlets. Everyone just booked a spot with me and then trucks will move it on. So quarterly, everyone just paying 157 bucks. Super affordable. Normally pest control gets more expensive on the initial service. Normally for a home your size be $369 just because it's more time, product and work. Since we're doing like David John and just 32 of the neighbors in the area already today and tomorrow, we're literally taking $100 off that first one. So it's just 269. The best part is, especially for those wasps that you got, like we're going to treat the pheromones that way they don't come back. Even in the future. You won't have to chase them around.

[00:37:10]
Chase them around.

[00:37:10]
Waste your Saturdays at Home Depot. If you see anything in between, just call us. We come back for free. That sound good?

[00:37:17]
Oh yeah. I mean I like that but I feel like it just like goes off subject with your pricing because like after you say that, like we're doing the neighbors, blah, blah, blah today, I feel like that already... Go ahead and take care of it. The only, only three result that would work for is maybe like someone saying I want to talk to my wife. But like 90% of the time that doesn't like go through anyway because that's just a smoke screen that...

[00:37:44]
Yeah.

[00:37:45]
Do we need both?

[00:37:45]
I think adding it into this one, it might need some smoothing out.

[00:37:49]
Yeah.

[00:37:49]
It's like I've done...

[00:37:50]
Because this is so direct.

[00:37:51]
Yeah. But it makes sense. We're like, like if I say if it goes in smoothie, like a lot of people have told me... Oh, well, okay. I guess you can answer today, right?

[00:38:02]
What would... I don't know. We can ask Alex. Honestly. Yeah, I mean I'm sure he doesn't like say any of that. And my man's selling almost, almost 10 every day, so is it really needed? I would ask him. Probably another way to get around it. He'll probably tell you the same thing today.

[00:38:15]
Today. Yeah, I think he's got another.

[00:38:20]
That's why I was probably asking. I got a lot of those yesterday and, and I'm gonna apply the today, today, today a lot more when I go out today. But like I know I'm still going to get some pushback with that. So... Yeah, maybe I'll just set callbacks a little bit more.

[00:38:42]
Yeah.

[00:38:43]
And do it that way. Yeah, probably just set callbacks with it. Like, you know what, I tell you what, like I'm sure you'll do your research. You just be like a smart guy. Like this is who we are, this is what we do. Give us a look up. I'm going to be out here till nine. So yeah, just give it some thought and I'll be back out here later today. Does that sound good? Awesome. Like if someone tells you no, like don't come back later day, like you're not showing them. Yeah, I feel like probably just sending a call down. Probably.

[00:39:12]
Would it be worth my while to stop back by on my way out? Yes.

[00:39:16]
I don't know if I would ask that because it's probably like more of a no question. Cuz if I don't know. Have you Built up enough value maybe, yes, but if not like I can set more callbacks for... For stuff like... Because some people do want to look over it. So yeah, you know what, like that's all just situational stuff, right?

[00:39:36]
Because if you're...

[00:39:37]
Because I had this one guy who's like in the middle of eating his hot dogs and I was like, okay, like totally got you this. Look great, great hot dogs. Obviously like you have some madabras up here. So doing all the neighborhood would be worth my while if I stopped back by like 20 minutes when you didn't...

[00:39:56]
Some people are really like, yeah, yeah, okay. I feel really good about those.

[00:40:00]
But if he's like like ah... But you know like all the time...

[00:40:04]
When they're actually like yeah, come back.

[00:40:05]
Yeah, but it's more like kind of like qualifying you like are you valuable?

[00:40:11]
I had a dude yesterday, pissed me off, it was kind of like that started going through the intro, asked him a question and he just looked at me and it was about 7:00 and I kept on going and he's like don't... You can't speak to me right now. You're not... You cannot speak to me like aggressively. And I'm like, what did you just say?

[00:40:28]
Yeah.

[00:40:29]
He's like, I'm eating dinner. Why the hell are you at my door? I'm like, I'm like, okay. I was like, yeah, have a good day. I was like, how the am I supposed to know you're eating dinner?

[00:40:37]
Yeah.

[00:40:38]
Are you this rude when people walk into your dog? Yeah, but I didn't let bother me cuz like an hour later I did get a sale.

[00:40:46]
Yeah, those people, I'm just like, all...

[00:40:48]
Right boys, come on in.

[00:40:50]
Good luck with life.

[00:40:51]
Yeah, right. You get that mad if someone comes in...

[00:40:59]
It's going to be a scorcher today. Okay, I just sign up there. I mean the thing with that here we're coming. It's like people to us. Just because I say I'm not giving out cards to the start doesn't mean they won't ask for one at the end necessarily. They're, they'll ask for the card if they don't feel like they see the value of winning now. So it's more about like... So how would it go about... About like just being assumptive and creating the need because it's like they're not going to want a card quite later. They feel like they need to do and they see the value. So it's less about like beating them the punch and More about... Because beating under the punch cost for sure. And I mitigate them saying, oh, yeah, since we're here today, everything come out. And then the pitching, like, you're standing up, but then getting to the end what's actually really highest. Like, see? So then it's just like, rack, rack, rack. Getting different angles, emotional appeal. Working on a college kid. Like, I like, I tell a lot of people, like, look, I just got married. You help me out, and I got to make it like a huge deal. But it's just like, maybe they're a sympathetic person. And then that hand in hand with, like, an ace. Takeaways from that, like, role play. What are things that you kind of realize, like, oh, I'm doing just guess that I shouldn't be doing. Super smooth, straightforward. Doesn't ramble on about... Yeah, 100%. I have been going back and forth between like, a quarter... Yeah, I know. And like... And then I do get the price... Objection. A lot of... Yeah, 100%. You gotta tease me, dude. I'm not gonna let people, like, just rush me through it. Like, pricing means next. Like this way. Yes. Yeah, like, less words, confident, steady pace. Awesome. What you and I were talking about... Darian, just, like, be super quick and concise with all of this, because my objective is to get through this so that we can address your objections. Wrap. Because that's actually how the cells are done. 100%. When I say it sounds good, I don't expect... I expect an objection. I'm literally saying, does that sound good? So I'm trying to, like, flush out your... So it's like, cool. What holds you back? How come that gets make sense? Get a good done. Whereas if I'm like, hey, does that sound good? And I'm like, yes. I'm like, oh, sick. That was easy. Cool. What's your phone number? So other thing... A really common spot. I think guys hesitate. I talked with Tyler Bryce in the interview about this as well. So when you're like, well, how many square feet is the home? And then, like, you feel nervous, which is, like, natural. And at this point, probably don't feel super nervous. We've done this for a while now. Excited, but it's like, excited you teasing yourself. Nothing weird right now. So. So it's, like, exciting. So, like, how many square feet your home? This is where typically guys start putting filler. I'm like, cool, so you guys have a super nice home. So for a home this size, we're coming out, like, it's super affordable. We're doing it for, like, now I can just draw this whole process out. Where instead, if I'm like, cool. How many square feet is your home? Listen to how many words I say before I say the number. How much square feet at your home? 1300. Awesome. So corn labor coming out 49 bucks. Like, how, like, direct is that? So direct. It's like, how many square feet are home? 300. Awesome. So corn would come out 159 bucks. It was, like, super affordable. And it's like, I'm not rushed. Like, I kind of, like pause and hesitate. Like, after I'm like, oh, yeah, it's super affordable. I let the number, like, sink in for a sec. Cool. Quarterly come out. It's literally just 159 bucks. So it's super affordable. The first one's usually $359, just because it takes more, like, time, work product. Since, like, already here we've done tons of neighbors taking $100 off. So just 249 bucks. And that's where everything. Especially get rid of the wasp. You guys get up high, you're going to see bucks are coming up. Don't have the hesitation here, because then it's just like, you sound and seem nervous. And also it makes the price a big deal where it's like I'm telling them the price the same way I tell them I'm going to granulate. Like, cool. You just get bugs out here in the yard. So we'll do a granule around the home. That way we get the bugs and source Johnny's perfect home third turns. Cool. So quarter ounce is 149 bucks. They're super affordable. The first one, just like, I'm just rolling it out the same way I roll out the rest of the...

[00:45:52]
I was just saying just to piggyback off what you're saying. Like, the more you add in filler stuff around there, the more it sounds like you're the quote or the estimate guy. Like, I'm here to give you a quote. Ask me for a card, please, so I can leave. And so it's like, it's... Yeah, it's like, so normal for home your size, if you want to do it, you know. But, yeah, I agree. Just taking out the filler, saying, Corvette, come out 149. Cool.

[00:46:16]
For a home your size, it's typically this, a quarter around that roughly, like, and, like, I'm the card that usually... Oh, I forgot him today. So maybe we should do it today. So I don't have my card. That's like, what I come Across. So no hedges. We're not playing basketball. Lots of headings if you're playing basketball. They're not. Let's go. Anyways, any last questions about this? And then you say, so we do thinking for everybody. So cool. Then we're Brandon around the arts. It gets rid of all the Vol. And then the cool thing is everything come out for free. Price wise, how much work? Awesome. We do the same thing for everyone. Treat them for 18 months. The reason being it's pretty easy to do robots. Does that make sense? Yeah. That's why we got to come out for poorly. We didn't do that way it would work. She said it was 3200. So coming out. Sometimes I do it like that. If I feel like I've been talking too much, I'll ask him, how many square feet you home? Can I go to the 18 months and answer? Well, yeah, so Corey was coming out. Or I'll be like, cool. So like how much is it? Awesome. So what we do, we treat them for 18 months, three days. It's probably better, I say just to go from like cool. Like I'll often say the guarantee before I get in here. Like I use the full slave resumes. They're cool. And then if you get seaboxes coming up for free. So price wise, we do the same thing for everyone. We treat the home for 18 months. Reason being it's pretty easy to get the go bucks. Probably get like eggs. Does that make sense? Cool. Quarterly. So we count quarterly how many square feature home. Awesome. So we're coming out to this. That way I don't repeat the how many square feature home questions. I think that's probably the best setup. Any other precautions? Cool. Okay. Let's do it, man. Let's do it, guys. Let's give a round of applause for Alex. You should know there's square footages fashion, remember? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I haven't made a new one. Shame on me. Dice dice. 50 push ups. That was an intense punishment. That was 500 cool. From yesterday. The guy texted me today and was like, my word, let's do this. And I was like, awesome. So like I said in the stuff and then he just never responded. We made my word. Let's go. Okay, cool. Let's go through roles real quick. Let's start with our joke of the day, Mr. T. Higgins. All right, gentlemen, A lot of bees have sticky hair. They use honeycomb. I love, I love how Tyler gets up there. He leans against the table. He looks like he's about to talk to us for 20 minutes, and then he's like, that's it. That's literally it. So think it real hard like this. Keep it simple. Okay. Darian, come on up here, dude. Good morning, sports fans. Yeah. So that's Drake's job, I guess. I was ready to say it, but he got some better voice for it, so he continued. I know. If you remember. Anyway. All right, guys, I have a question again. What country has competed the most times with the Summer Olympics, but it's never one gold medal? No. Brazil. What language do they speak? Can you give us... That's going to give it away. It's in Asia. Can you give us Japan? China? Laos? Malaysia? Vietnam. Vietnam, Singapore, Korea, Philippines? Yeah, they've been... He never went to the Olympics, bro. But they've never won a gold medal. And they've been to the Summer Olympics more times than they do. And that's the thing. They don't believe they can do it. Also, when LeBron James comes down the court. Right there. That's good. So today, for your nutrition, make sure when you eat lunch. And this is something I try not to do. I never eat anything hot for lunch like that. I cook, because then it just makes me feel more weighted down and goes. When I go into doors. So for lunch, I always stick to. I just take my turkey or ham, wrap some cheese around it, and that's it. So, like, you guys can do whatever you want, but keep lunches light because then you guys won't feel tired when you get out in the sun. You guys start knocking doors, you're out. Yeah. Carbs as well. Okay. All right. Your investment advice for the day. Everyone knows we're in inflammatory times, so real estate goes up during those. But you may ask yourself, trey, I...

[00:52:01]
Don'T have money to buy a house. What do I do?

[00:52:03]
That's why I'm here. So last night, I did some research, and a stock called BNQ is one of the best publicly traded real estate investment Trusts. It's about $100 a share, but it's very, very reliable. But if you don't have that type of money to put in $100 of shares, it's always good to have, like, gold and precious metal exposure. So, obviously, gold is a lot, but there's IAU. It's a gold trust that's really affordable. It's about $35. So everyone knows gold is super valuable. So there's your investment love lights for the day. Nice. Well, this is fun. This one is bright. It is an insect. And the first part of Its name is the name of another insect. What is it about an insect? It is an insect but the first part of the scene. What's another one? Besides right. We don't have music India. Cuz we sell a lot of people from India. I decided I'd do a nature fact about India is home to 57% of the global tiger population. 57% of the tigers India. Yeah. I feel like 57% of the world's population. Yeah, they're 18%. One out of five people I like what kind of chill you want. Things went real downhill since you it's part green eggs, part brothel. You were a lot better when I was gone. I saw a video back.

[00:55:52]
James is sending you.

[00:55:53]
Did he send you the video of when he joined in? No, he took his shirt off. He took one of our dusters and he went crazy with it. Oh, if I get dinner as well. Dinner as well. You can film it. Good.

[00:56:17]
Post it to next door.

[00:56:24]
That makes other wasp become super aggressive.

[00:56:32]
Land on you.

[00:56:33]
Yes. Kids. My ears were ringing like like yesterday. No, I literally have him like zoom up in my face and like hit me and then like scream at me. That's like the quiet place. Monsters.

[00:56:58]
Oh yeah. Yeah.

[00:57:01]
All right. Shower thought. All right.

[00:57:12]
So... So our thoughts is we should have a holiday called Space Day where lights are are to be shut off for at least an hour at night to reduce light... Light pollution so we can see the galaxy.

[00:57:26]
There's a such thing as light pollution.

[00:57:28]
Yeah. Yeah. So like the lights and flash off the clouds and you can't see the stars into like a city from far away. You can like see it like Las Vegas where I'm from. Like you don't see the stars much cuz it's just so bright. But yeah, so if you imagine we're...

[00:57:43]
From Alabama so we see stars everywhere.

[00:57:47]
Yeah.

[00:57:48]
That would actually be way sick.

[00:57:49]
That'd be dope. I think we need to...

[00:57:58]
All right, some love advice. Who here has ever had to say goodbye? Don't cry kids at work from hell. Because it happens, right? No, like it's... It's definitely tough. Like... Like long distance can be tough. And like when you're like away from each other, work or whatever. Like cash in at six weeks through the summer, fall, summer... Away from each other. Like just finding little ways to like connect still. Whether that's like through little text or ordering Amazon gifts or like having your friend like deliver something or like there's a lot of really inexpensive ways to like show you're thinking of someone and then Two, just like wrecking magic too. When it is hard, just always remembering, like the why of what you're doing. And like, even like during the day where it's like like Monday sometimes can be tricky because, like, you're just getting off the weekend. Like, maybe you just spent five hours driving the car. You're in Kirtland the whole day and you're drinking water so you're tired. Sleeping for a friend. But it's just like he's like, live in the moment. Be grateful. Remember your why. He's like, right. And I wasn't necessarily super stoked to like go out and knock. Would have been way more fun. Just like chill at home with my money. Like, I haven't spent a lot of time with my money recently. I don't even like I touched my money yesterday. But like, probably. But so anyways, find little ways to like keep your significant like in loop even when you're doing long distance or if you're like, love it. All right, Bradley Henman. Are we getting away for Dallas? We can just go. Put your numbers in real quick. We still need Jared Hunter. Bradley. How about Jared dancing? Okay, so let's have everyone have it in. Also just to make a glance to us like, like say the first time we say the deals and then we clap and then when you go through again, you say revenue ACV number of 18 months out of number sold and then average. Does that make sense? Have... Have it open so we can say smooth. Yeah, you will. Alex. 8 3. Alice 3032 Jerry. Kyler. 1 J 1 Jerry. Trevor did not Hunter. So 58... 10 in revenue. 726 ACV and 6 out of 8. 18 months. 155 initial. 2185 rev. 728 AC me 2 of the 3 months or 46 initial. Dallas did 1895. 632 ACV 2 for 3 and then 1, 2, 9.

[01:02:06]

[01:03:36]

[01:03:36]
8:45.

[01:03:37]
One for one.

[01:03:45]
Trevor one. Yes. So yesterday matchups, who won? I did change fix how it is now supposed yesterday. Yeah. Eight to six. You did however six at 9:40. I was going to say he... He caught up quick bucks at 9:40. I texted him. I was like, you got more tonight. And I did three more after dance. But now I tell you what... Like, I want to beat guys on the best days. I also want like, hopefully the competition is. I mean, is Jackson good? Jackson putting your brother in this place today. Do it. I got... I got two brothers competing against each other. Can't hear. Yes. Kayla, was it Cassidy yesterday? You beat Cassidy. Caleb is against Joseph Mask today. Jose gets hard. He got 11 yesterday. He showed up. We got 11 yesterday. Yeah. No way. You guys turn out big, dude. Caleb's got the Drake another year. Yeah.

[01:05:25]
Antonio Amadesa or something.

[01:05:28]
Oh, yeah. That doesn't sound...

[01:05:32]
That's cute. Get four. Make sure ricey never that Karina. You never know. Don't never to underestimate. Like, I started off quick and at like five pretty quick. And Zach was at two or three. And it's just like I think part of me like cooled down in the evening. Like I said, I got off the doors at 9:40. Like I wasn't like not trying this tonight. It was... I feel like I... I don't know if this my critic or not, but it's like I beat it by 400 bucks. That's a deal. I guess I 69. 119. So it's like you're selling $940 contracts to like it's never over. And he got the door is actually 10 out... Like late late. So it's like don't play down to your competition. Like, don't just think like, oh, yesterday they did this stuck today. Or it's like every day's a new day. Anyone can go out and do 10 in a give day. Like, if you don't believe that, like you should just because you haven't done it. This should. And you can't so. And then everyone else, like if you're not in it, like when the... When the rest of like everyone's dying, like be a top pro, be a top vet, be a top... Like win yourself back from bones. 1500 bones. Be a driver, massage chair. So it makes it fun. Compete. Get the dps. Brock and me come up here man in all the land as well. Caleb Jay's gonna have a big day today. Tomorrow and just like be myself. Go out here today, enjoy it don't be a stuff you learn, like, but also, like, keep the... I... I love Josh's training. What are some of the takeaways you guys had from, like, Josh's training?

[01:07:44]
Like, Yeah, I mean, it's always default.

[01:07:49]
Yeah.

[01:07:50]
So if you don't take control of...

[01:07:52]
It, then it's why... Why be negative? Can anyone give me a good reason to be negative? Negative. This is the, just the most easy and natural way to like, it's like you said, the default. Yeah. Like, if you, if you're going in your area and like, you just start telling yourself, everyone here sucks. Like, my area sucks. Everyone is pissed. No one's going to bite me. It's like, what is that going to do? Like, there's going to be zero positive outcomes. Now maybe you still sell because you're good at selling. You know how to sell and do it. But why feed yourself with stuff that's going to just, like, hurt you? You might as well just like brainwash yourself into thinking, dude, this area is so sick. Everyone here loves me. Like, there's so many people they didn't talk to. They warmed him up. Like, I love the challenge. I get better every day. Like, you might as well just have those thoughts going through your mind because then like, actually that's going to create something positive as opposed to just like creating something... How are morning routines this morning? Good. Good. What? Why we're here. It's awesome.

[01:09:03]
I love that.

[01:09:05]
Red. Red. Great. Went to the gym, listen to a talk, eat breakfast. Full, hearty breakfast. Even if I take an L today on the book, which I won't, but I still want this one. Your wrist. Good. And you didn't have a rewards here. That's your pain. Like, to be straight up. Like, I didn't. Like, I was tired. Like, I was up late last night and it's like I slept in, took a shower. I have the same thing. It's like, I'm gonna go out and have a great day today. Like, I'm not gonna, like, burst myself. It's like, honestly, like, a lot of mornings chill anyways. Maybe that is my routine chill. But like, I, I try not to get down on myself. It's like, oh, no, I was tomorrow. Like the anything I've ever been good at in my life, like, I typically haven't been good at at the start, like basketball, I thought I was really good. Like, I studied in seventh grade, eighth grade, I was on the practice team and like, I sat with Dennis the whole year. Ninth grade, made rushing team, 10th grade. Started JB 11th grade. I like, played JV, which said, you know, like RC sports. Like, you don't want to be on JB, it's kind of like, okay, but like, we don't want young versus not big boys. I sat varsity half a year my senior year. And like, I don't know what, like, I, for whatever reason, I love basketball and I was willing to go through all that. I'd like, I'd go to practice early. I'd always be the first in the gym. I'd play a game. Like, I get there early. I'd try shoot around, do a JD game. I like, say varsity, whatever. After the varsity game, I like sit and shoot in the gym, like when everyone else is gone and then I go home because, like, I loved it and I wanted to be really big. Then senior year, I started every single game, like team captain. Like, I didn't have a crazy number. So I averaged like 10 games, like a week, rebounds a game. It's like pretty good for N6 big guy. And like, I was like team captain. We won Spur League, like an all star game at the end of the season with like all the other senior players that scored like 20 something game like MVP, whatever, where it's like, I didn't just show up to that. Like, I was literally SAT in seventh grade. I sat varsity for half a year. Like, most people would probably be like, okay, that kid's probably done, he's not gonna play. But it's like, dude, I wanted this. And it's like I wasn't just like some God given talent and like selling as well. Like, I wasn't. Like, I didn't just show up my first year and just like super good. Like, I grinded to prepare. Like, I memorized the pitch. I did it. It was my own. I worked so hard every single day the whole summer. I stayed later than most guys in the summer. Like, I finished, I think a number four rookie first year, like Galison, I were in the office more than anyone else in the off season. And it's like anyone else, seriously, we even freaking cuticle love. But like, enjoyed it, like, worked hard. And it's like, it's cool to like see it, like, pay off. Hard work always pays off. Like, if you show me a person that's super committed to their goals and they want it like that person guaranteed maybe today will be the best day ever. Maybe maybe today they won't be the top of the company, but eventually they will because they're gonna work for it. So keep that in mind. Today it's like anything, at least for me, I'm sure for a lot of you guys too. You all have similar stories, like, whether it's in sports or music or whatever. You didn't just show up and just like all of a sudden you were the best and no one was bound you. You were no one at first. No one knew your name, no one knew how good you were. No one thought you were good. And they saw you, they didn't have this guy is anything special. But like, work hard work for it. Take five, new work ethic. Like, love the day in, love the day out. Just like getting better. Every door you're polishing, you're like applying the things you learn. You're getting a little bit better to the point where then like all of a sudden, then you start taking off. You start doing 2, 3, 4, day, start doing 10, 15, 20, 25. Like I never, like last year, like when I did 41 in a week, like, I thought I was selling ancillaries. Like this year I did like 58 week. And like, wow, that's all the counts I've done. I've done 40, 50 accounts last few weeks. And like, it... Like, as a rookie, that seemed crazy. Doing 20 and week used to seem like crazy to me. But like, you stay with it, you stay focused. It's big grindy, Go good on yourself, don't put on the job. Then like all of a sudden you realize, like, kid, like, I can do this and I... I can do more than I thought. And you don't realize it, but it's like, who, who thinks that? Like, they're way better now than they were to start the summer. I'm way better now than the start of the sun. And like a lot of times you think like, well, like, I know how to pay attention. How much better can you get at it? But it's like just every day doing the job, you just get better. So know that today let's go out, make a huge day, compete with majors, be happy. If you feel tired, like, that's okay, that's normal. Drink water, have a protein bar, make sure you're eating enough. Put sunscreen on, smile, be happy. Positive affirmations, good vibes. Let's make today a great day as a team. Like, what do we want to do today? Huge. 35. You said 55. 35. 35 is great number. Cool. We need, we need everyone to do it. Like we all do three plus. Then boom, we're there. 6, 7, 8, 10, 12. So let's go ahead and do it. Quick lunch. Meet everyone in the lobby, 12:15 and then the door to car. So be great. On three. One, two, three.

# ðŸ’¬ Day 1 Email â€“ Self-Prompt Interview Q&A (Voice Note AI) (Raw Transcript)

[00:00:01]
**Bradley:**
All right, so here's what we're gonna do. We're going to do the day one, email, self prompt interview, Q and A. Right. Question and answer.

[00:00:14]
**Bradley:**
Basically. I've got all the. Basically converted the rhetorical structure template into a self prompt interview question template. And so just going to go down the line like bullet point by bullet point, answer these questions to the best of my ability. And I'm going to use this as basically brain dump content for both my personal, like human written, basically AI unassisted draft.

[00:00:43]
**Bradley:**
Right. That is prong number one, prong one of writing this email. And then also this is going to be obviously the same brain dump content that Arno will use when he goes to write prong 2, which is the AI draft. Right. Okay, so let's roll through this.

[00:01:05]
**Bradley:**
And I think I wanted to, what I want to do, I wanted to make sure that for each, I can't remember what the constraint was, but for every single question. So for each question I think I wanted to aim for like one or two paragraphs of like a minimum of one paragraph, but probably one or two paragraphs of content in terms of my answer. And I think what I was aiming for was like probably a maximum of two to five minutes. I think it's either two minutes or five minutes of replying to each question. So I'm going to try to try to hard cap that.

[00:01:51]
**Bradley:**
I can't remember those constraints, but those. That's what I'll go with. Okay, let's do this. Okay, cool. Yeah, I just double checked my voice note and that is what it is.

[00:02:00]
**Bradley:**
So we're aiming for one to two paragraphs of voice note transcript text in terms of my answers to these questions. Each question or about, you know, trying to keep it under two minutes for each response. And definitely a hard, hard cap of five minutes for each individual question. I only anticipate that I'll go on a rant for a few of these. Okay, so let's roll.

[00:02:34]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so this is for the, for the subject line and the preview subtext. Okay. So the subject line, the question is, what's the punchiest way to describe this mistake in five to ten words? Let's see. I think we're just going to go with a prescriptive way, like mistake number one.

[00:02:56]
**Bradley:**
Treating your AI like a customer service agent. Right. Treating your AI like a generic customer service agent. Something like that. Right.

[00:03:06]
**Bradley:**
And then the preview subtext, the question is, what's the most immediate. Or sorry, what is, what's the immediate painful consequence that'll grab my Reader's attention in the preview text. Okay, so I think, let's see. I don't know, man. Like, and again, this, this can be either an immediate painful consequence or it could be like a immediate beneficial reward of avoiding the mistake.

[00:03:39]
**Bradley:**
Right. So it's either negative outcome or positive outcome. Just flip flopped. Whatever you want to do. Let's see.

[00:03:51]
**Bradley:**
I think really just having like these, I don't know, these like frustrating robotic conversations that don't feel like you're talking with a real friend or a real person. Just these rigid robotic interactions. Again, that does not feel like you are speaking with a thought partner or a collaborative partner or a friend. I mean, maybe we should include that there. Because the subject line, the mistake is basically the first half.

[00:04:20]
**Bradley:**
Right. Treating your AI like a generic customer service agent. So maybe we should incorporate the phrase collaborative partner in the preview subtext somehow. So something like, ever wish your chats with AI felt more like talking with a collaborative partner or I don't know, something along those lines. We'll figure it out.

[00:04:44]
**Bradley:**
I need Arno's input on the, on this. Cool. So something like that.

[00:04:57]
**Bradley:**
Cool. So now we are going on to the email component structure plus element outline. Okay, so the intro is pretty.

[00:05:11]
**Bradley:**
Let's see.

[00:05:20]
**Bradley:**
I guess we have to figure out what goes in brackets. So like the part that says specifically and then bullet point, the reason solar partners make this mistake. Next bullet point, why negative outcome happens. And then third bullet point is just set in stone. It's and how to fix it.

[00:05:38]
**Bradley:**
Right. We're not going to change that.

[00:05:43]
**Bradley:**
I don't know. I'm going to go with Arno's help on this one. I'm probably just going to. Or I'm going to riff it and figure it out. Okay.

[00:05:53]
**Bradley:**
I mean I could say something like the reason solopreneurs make this mistake without realizing it. And the next bullet is why your conversations sound so robotic. Or why are conversations, why are conversations feel like fighting with a stranger instead of flowing with a friend? Something like that. Right, cool.

[00:06:21]
**Bradley:**
And then third bullet point is and how to fix it. It stays the same always.

[00:06:29]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. Okay, now we are on the main point of the mistake, mistake number one. And we'll insert that there. So first bullet point, what is the mistake? So this is the question.

[00:06:45]
**Bradley:**
What is the mistake? State it simply and directly. Blunt and point blank. What's a shocking stat or truth that reveals how common this mistake is? So here's my answer.

[00:06:59]
**Bradley:**
I would say like 95% of solopreneurs talk to ChatGPT. Like it's Siri from 2011, right? And it's not their fault because they've been trained this way. Like you. Basically you've been inadvertently trained to interact with AI like this.

[00:07:24]
**Bradley:**
But that's the problem. Right? Cool. Next question. When and where does mistake show up in common relatable situations?

[00:07:34]
**Bradley:**
When you see someone make this mistake, what exactly do they do? What are some specific examples of how this mistake, AKA problem, manifests in real life? So let's see. I would say.

[00:07:55]
**Bradley:**
So I would say, yeah, so basically, let's see. I mean what, what this looks like, just like on a basic level is anytime you see someone pull up, pull up ChatGPT and they give a really short generic command based prompt such as, please summarize this, right? Or give me, give me some blog post ideas about X. Right? Like give me some blog post ideas about AI or whatever topic it is, right?

[00:08:43]
**Bradley:**
Like just super, super short, generic, like command based prompts, right? Basically, basically how you would communicate with Siri, right? You give a command, there's no, I mean it's not like a conversation at all, I think. And again, I've talked about this in other brain dump content, but you would never say to a friend, like, if you're communicating with a real friend, you never say, hey, give me some blog post ideas about AI, right? You would, you'd give them more context, right?

[00:09:17]
**Bradley:**
You'd say like, hey, so I'm brainstorming some blog post ideas because I'm a content creator and here's the topic I want to focus on. I can share some of my unique perspectives or ideas, but what I want to get right now is just some basic ideas to get the juices flowing.

[00:09:42]
**Bradley:**
Here's my topic and like maybe here are some things that I want to avoid or that I don't care about talking about. And here's some like a couple key points that I really do want to focus on, right? It could be subtopics. Just, just basically like imagine it's, it's a night and day difference. Like instead of imagining like, oh, hey, I'm talking to Siri and I need to give a super short, like five word prompt to make sure that she understands and doesn't go off the rails.

[00:10:13]
**Bradley:**
Instead of imagining that, imagine that like you are talking to a very intelligent, competent, super approachable friend that you really get along with and you're just having a conversation, right? Like that. That's sort of the mental reframe, which I guess this is kind of an answer to. Later point, a later question. But Yeah, I think for the most part, I think it's just people really, really underutilizing ChatGPT's capabilities because they are stuck in this rigid, like command, command prompt mode and they don't.

[00:10:49]
**Bradley:**
And especially here too. Like, it's not just the first prompt that they give, right? Like, I was just giving an example of a first prompt, but like in the followup in the feedback, when the AI gives you, you know, maybe two ideas that you do like and then three ideas that you don't care for, instead of just like following up with something else generic like I like idea one and two, could you expand those right? Like, oh man, say I like ideas 1 and 2 because X, Y and Z. The others don't appeal to me because like abc, I don't really care about that.

[00:11:29]
**Bradley:**
So could we focus on ideas one and two and could you expand those by like giving me some real life examples of what that might look like in real life and then I can add my own perspective to that or something like that where you're giving more, you're giving more, like just much better feedback, like, hey, I like this because. And then insert reason why, right? And I don't like these other ones. Or I don't care about these because insert reason X like you're, you're giving. I mean, I guess this is really like, it's kind of like Yin Yang prompting, but it's more like Yin Yang feedback.

[00:12:08]
**Bradley:**
And then you're just clarifying your goal too. Like, hey, here's what I'm thinking. Right? Here's the goal again, here's more what I'm thinking. And then you are adding your own personal, like, unique perspective or context or, you know, viewpoints to really, like, give the AI something to go off of and something to collaborate with.

[00:12:29]
**Bradley:**
Right? Instead of just saying, hey, like you there, you servant boy, do this for me. All right? So anyway, that's my answer to that. I think that manifests really in your life, like a lot.

[00:12:42]
**Bradley:**
Just really. I mean, again, giving these rigid command based prompts because people are treating it like Siri and just really not understanding, like, how much better and like more accurately and more like, effectively the AI can collaborate with them in a way that's really fun. Like in a way that just feels natural and smooth. It just feels like a natural conversation instead of a back and forth Siri fight conversation. Right, Cool.

[00:13:16]
**Bradley:**
Next question. What's the immediate negative impact? What's the painful missed opportunity this pitfall results in? And why does that matter? Or why should my reader Care.

[00:13:28]
**Bradley:**
Well, I mean, I don't know how to say this concisely, but like, I mean, I think on one level, it's really just a way more enjoyable experience to speak and, like, have a natural conversation with an AI friend that gets you that just feels like a normal human. Just. It's much more of that, like, group partner vibe. Kind of like, here's the college project, here's a group partner that really, like, your best friend is going to be your group partner, right? Not Siri.

[00:14:01]
**Bradley:**
Like, get away from the Siri vibe. Instead, insert your group partner, who's your best friend, super smart, and, like, has their own complimentary ideas. It's just a lot more fun. And I think too, like, I don't know. I don't know how to say this succinctly, but I think as a result, partially like the AI it, you become much better at communicating your own, like, your own content to the AI.

[00:14:28]
**Bradley:**
Like you're communicating your goal, your preferences, the things you care about, the things you don't like. So the AI starts to get you a lot more right? Whether it's through the use of memories or, you know, you're able to update these things in the custom instructions when you're giving it a personality. Or I think really at the fundamental level, like, you are just becoming a much better communicator and conversationalist and you're better able to communicate what you're aiming for. And so as a result, the AI responses are going to be 10 times more on point.

[00:15:02]
**Bradley:**
You're going to discover things that you never even realized that are super valuable for yourself and for your, like, for your readers as a solopreneur who's publishing content. And I think, like, that's really the difference is you're going to have a collaborative partner that's going to point out things that you've never even thought of that will be a slam dunk and resonate with your target readers and ultimately make you more money, save you more time, create better relationships between you and your audience because the AI is your collaborative partner. So just so much more. It's in such a better position to actually effectively serve you and help you when you treat it like that instead of the servant. Right?

[00:15:49]
**Bradley:**
It just. It's a night and day difference. It's like having an incompetent intern who just graduated high school and doesn't have any ambition or any personality traits in common with you versus having like a college best friend who's collaborating with you. And you actually have the same energy Same wavelength. And you actually like, you hit slam dunk home run projects because, like, you're just vibing together and you're able to just create so much better work and it feels so much more enjoyable.

[00:16:26]
**Bradley:**
So I think that's the two things is like, I mean, number one, this is more of a service level thing, but like, it just feels so much better. It feels so much more natural. It feels like a conversation. It makes the process enjoyable instead of frustrating and like anger inducing because the AI actually gets you and you are getting the AI. And then the second thing is you just produce so much better results because the AI actually like, you and the AI are on the same page, you're on the same wavelength and you connect and you complement each other in ways you never expected.

[00:17:00]
**Bradley:**
Right. So the outputs, the results that you create as a result of these AI chats or AI conversations are so much better. Again, they make you more money, save you more time and energy, they reinvigorate you with energy, they create better relationships between you and your target audience. All that stuff. Okay.

[00:17:24]
**Bradley:**
And again, you know, the missed opportunity is losing all those positive things, like not resonating, not connecting with your readers, Spending hours and hours, like trying to do everything yourself, not just feeling overwhelmed, just feeling overwhelmed by all you have to do, not really connecting with your readers.

[00:17:47]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I mean, like having to drain all your time and energy, either trying to do this stuff on your own or trying to fight with an AI that just does not cooperate and ultimately feels like a waste of time. And just having a really, like, bad nightmarish experience, feeling like you're trying to flow in a natural conversation with Siri, which just does not happen. Cool. So the next main point section.

[00:18:25]
**Bradley:**
So the next main point is the reason this happens. Right. So first question, looking back in time, where did this mistake originate? Like, where did it originally start happening and why? And what are some specific relatable examples of real life situations that formed this old POV or belief in people's minds in the first place?

[00:18:47]
**Bradley:**
I think I've shared everything I need to on this in other sections of this brain dump content, which will be, again, I pointed to Siri and Alexa and, you know, generic, like customer service, like phone trees, basically, where you have to. Where it's like, press 7 if you'd like to speak with a representative. Or like, say seven if you'd like to speak with a representative. And then you say seven and the robot's like, did you say W? Sorry, that's not a correct answer.

[00:19:27]
**Bradley:**
Goodbye. And then like, you know, those type of experiences. So I think again, Siri or Alexa or these customer. So like customer service, automated phone. Phone, I don't know what to call them.

[00:19:41]
**Bradley:**
Phone systems that are just nightmarish and you're never able to speak to a human. You have to speak with this crappy robot that doesn't understand anything you say. Right? And again, look at my other examples within the other sections of this brain dump content for more clarity and even better ways of sharing those examples and wording those things. So, yeah, so next question.

[00:20:09]
**Bradley:**
Why do smart solopreneurs fall for this? What makes it so tempting and prevalent? Well, I think it's just really, it's just the way that everybody's been trained, right? Everybody's been trained into these rigid command systems instead of having a natural conversation like before ChatGPT, like you could never have a natural normal conversation with a robot. It just wouldn't happen.

[00:20:36]
**Bradley:**
Right? And even with the first versions, I think this is an important point too. With the very first versions of ChatGPT like GPT 3.5, those versions were still very like young and immature. And so like, yes, they were better than Siri in some way, but they were almost just as frustrating because of the way they responded. Right?

[00:21:03]
**Bradley:**
Whether that was the style or like it didn't get you. So it was like, it was like Siri's slightly smarter older cousin, but it wasn't like, it wasn't anything, you know, human like essentially. Right. But I think with more recent models, again with GPT 4:04 Omni and Claude by anthropic, right. Claude 3.5 sonnet and some of these other models, like these things are so much more intelligent and like natural in terms of the conversations you can have with them.

[00:21:40]
**Bradley:**
It just feels so much better. So anyway, again, I think it's that it's tempting because that's just the way things have always been. And also it's lazy on your part too because you're like, I don't know if it's just due to unawareness or like obliviousness because people just don't know how. They don't know that having a natural conversation with AI will give them so much better results. And so they just default to the old way that they've kind of inherited as like their default pov, which is the rigid command based stuff like Siri.

[00:22:21]
**Bradley:**
Or maybe they, I think another part is it is just that people are maybe lazy and they're like, hey, I want you to do this. And they sort of expect the AI to read their mind based on a one sentence prompt. And like without more context and clarity, it just doesn't work. And that's just the exact same way that it would in real life if you're training an employee or if you're having a conversation with a friend. Like they're totally going to misinterpret you with one sentence prompts.

[00:22:53]
**Bradley:**
And so I think people expect it to respond like a human just based on one sentence prompts and they expect it to read their minds. And they are lazy. They don't want to. They either don't know how to or they don't want to share more useful information in the prompt. I think again, it's a lack of skill, it's a lack of awareness, probably lack of awareness first off, but also on another level it's a lack of skill and also some sort of laziness.

[00:23:23]
**Bradley:**
Right, cool. Next question. So what? So yeah, I think people just haven't been trained. Next question.

[00:23:34]
**Bradley:**
So what does the cause and effect chain look like that leads to the end result, AKA the ultimate negative outcome and one domino at a time. So it's kind of like this cause happens which leads to that effect, which leads to this result. And what's the deeper cost of staying stuck here?

[00:24:01]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I mean, I feel like I've talked about this a lot, but it's kind of like again, the immediate negative impact is you're having really like crappy, just not fun, frustrating conversations back and forth. So the process sucks. Um, and then on a second level you get worse outputs, so you get worse results. So you're not as you know, you're not living up your highest self, you're not living up to your full potential as a solopreneur because you're not using AI in a way that it can collaborate with you. So you're just stuck like by yourself, trying to do everything.

[00:24:42]
**Bradley:**
But yeah, and I mean, I think I've described sort of where these outcomes lead to in these two different levels.

[00:24:52]
**Bradley:**
But yeah, man, I mean people, people just don't understand how to give their AI an identity and personality and sort of collaborative nature or interaction style. And so they default to these command based prompts which they've inherited from ancient AIs like Siri.

[00:25:12]
**Bradley:**
And it leads to those negative outcomes which I've already described. So yeah, that's the deeper cost of staying stuck here is just, I think that everybody else around you, whether they're your role models or your peers, they start to, they start to excel, they start to gain pattern recognition, they start to like, they start to really level up and get results as a result of being able to collaborate with AI. And you stay stuck where you are because you're clueless and you have a lack of awareness and a lack of knowledge and you just feel like you're spinning your wheels. You feel like you're seeing people take off and get it and really like be successful and enjoy using AI. And you're stuck here with like a one recipe cookbook and you're wondering why you can't make a delicious meal, why you can't get the results that your peers and maybe your role models or your mentors are getting and why does it feel so easy for them, why does it look so effortless?

[00:26:12]
**Bradley:**
And why am I stuck like with these same damn results? And so yeah, I think there's a sense of potentially being, feeling like you're being left behind maybe through comparison to other people and just really like again, other people being able to harness and really use this technology really well while you still feel like you are stuck to the era of technology you were born in and you're not really able to catch up. So you get left behind in the dust. I don't know, something like that. And ultimately it's more of a light like really you get left behind in the dust, but it's more of like what's the result on your lifestyle or your social situation or I don't know, whatever you aspire to.

[00:26:56]
**Bradley:**
You're comparing yourself to role models and peers and mentors and that's really sort of the. Again, most fears are relational. They're a result of like self doubt or identity struggles, beliefs. It's not just getting left behind. It's like I'm getting left behind in relation to other people that I know and respect and look up to and want to be like succeeding with.

[00:27:22]
**Bradley:**
Why am I the one left behind? Right, cool.

[00:27:31]
**Bradley:**
Next main point. This one next main point is and how to fix it. Right. Okay, so we're starting off with the main sub point of the mindset. First question, what's the simple truth about fixing this mistake?

[00:27:45]
**Bradley:**
What's the new pov, AKA the fundamental mental reframe? And how does this contrast with the old pov? Right, so I think I've talked about this ad nauseam, but simple truth is once you start treating AI as a collaborative partner instead of a generic tool and you start learning how to do that, like you gain, first off, you gain awareness of how you can, how that even happens, how it's possible. And then second off, you gain the skill, which is actually like learning the principles, learning the skills to apply, applying the templates, like, all that kind of stuff. And like, putting this, Putting this into action in real life for yourself and practicing like that is all of a sudden, it's totally transformed.

[00:28:41]
**Bradley:**
I think you. I don't know how to say this, but, like, you all of a sudden are the one, like, understanding and using technology in ways that blow your friends away, that blow other people away, that, like, blow you away in ways that you discover new things by yourself, in ways that you, again, connect with your audience on a deeper, more meaningful level. You're making more. More money, you're gaining more freedom. Again, it's an abundance of freedom and those other factors.

[00:29:15]
**Bradley:**
But, yeah, I mean, the simple truth is instead of treating AI like a generic tool, you start treating it like a collaborative partner. And you apply my specific instructions on how to do that. Like, the actual skills. You gain the awareness, and then you gain the skills. Okay.

[00:29:33]
**Bradley:**
Um, and you start interacting with it differently.

[00:29:39]
**Bradley:**
And the AI, like, again, I can't emphasize this enough is like, it's kind of like the golden rule, right? Treat people how you would want to be treated, or what you send out gets returned to you. Like karma. You can call it whatever you want, but, like, when you start treating the AI as a real, like, person, as a collaborative partner and friend, it starts treating you like a real person, as a collaborative partner and friend. Like, that's the night and day mindset shift is like, it stops acting like a robot when you treat it like a real person, so it treats you back like a real person.

[00:30:13]
**Bradley:**
And it's actually a fun conversation. Fun interactions, because you're actually going somewhere now, and it feels fluid and natural. Okay, next question.

[00:30:26]
**Bradley:**
What are the simple steps to implement this fix? Like, basically, what's the basic preview of the action steps? So basic preview is you give your AI an identity and a personality. Or I guess you could say identity, personality, and interaction style. And the way you do that is using custom instructions.

[00:30:46]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:30:50]
**Bradley:**
I mean, that's really the main thing. I think maybe a second thing is you start, like, you start upgrading your prompting skills. Like the way the type of prompts, the prompts that you either communicate conversationally or type out, you start communicating differently in the actual chat thread as well, right? So first you set up custom instructions, give it identity, personality, interaction style. Second, you start.

[00:31:18]
**Bradley:**
You start changing your prompting style, you start speaking more conversationally as you would to a friend. That changes the messages you send to the AI in your chat threads and that changes the responses or outputs that you get from your AI friend, right?

[00:31:38]
**Bradley:**
Um, and I think maybe third would just be like, expect this to evolve over time. Like you want to, you want to take an experimental approach, right? Like, this is not going to be a one and done thing where you just write out your custom instructions once as a first draft and then you tweak a couple things about your prompting style and then voila, magically fixed, right? Like, no, you're going to refine and iterate based on feedback, based on the results. You're going to upgrade your custom instructions over time, very iteratively, over like a period of weeks and months.

[00:32:20]
**Bradley:**
And then you're also going to like, expect to evolve. Shut up.

[00:32:29]
**Bradley:**
You're also going to expect to evolve like as a conversationalist, as a, like your prompting skills, right? So I think that's, that's a major thing is you're going to expect to evolve through your communication skills with AI, as a, you as a person, as a conversationalist. And really like, your messages in the chat threads are going to get better and better and you have to refine and tweak your approach based on, you know, your experiences, based on your firsthand interactions and the results you get. And you're going to have to tweak, you know, little things about your prompts. You might tweak the wording, you might tweak the instructions, you might edit a prompt, you might regenerate a response.

[00:33:16]
**Bradley:**
Like, just expect that you are going to experiment with your prompting style, like your messages in the chat threads as well as the custom instructions. Okay, cool. So those are basically the three things. So what's the next question? What's the transformative outcome waiting for my reader on the other side?

[00:33:35]
**Bradley:**
I think I've described this in detail already. You're going to have conversations that actually feel like you're speaking with a real person in real life. You're going to, again, you're going to evolve as a person. You're going to become a much better communicator and conversationalist as a result. You're going to connect with your audience members much better.

[00:33:54]
**Bradley:**
You're going to have deeper relationships with them. You're going to make more money. You're going to feel like your time and effort and energy that you've invested is actually making an impact, like a two times greater impact. And you're going to gain a skill that like everybody really wants and needs, but most people don't know how to get it again, which is Using AI for your business or your personal life. Whatever you want to do.

[00:34:25]
**Bradley:**
All right, next section. So this is the main sub point. This is action steps. What are the exact steps to implement this fix? Like, what should my reader do first, next, last?

[00:34:38]
**Bradley:**
I think I'm just gonna hammer this out and write it out, like through the use of screenshots. I'm gonna, maybe I'm gonna act. Maybe I'll record myself doing a screen recording, like a really rough draft one, and just be like, okay, kind of like I guided Lara, Mom's friend Lara, through how to do this. Maybe I'll revisit that notion page and I'll just basically be like, okay, cool. What did I walk her through?

[00:35:05]
**Bradley:**
How did that go down? And yeah, I don't know, maybe practice it. Practice speaking out loud. Like I'm coaching somebody through this on a, on a zoom call, like on a video consult. Consult call.

[00:35:18]
**Bradley:**
I don't know, we'll figure it out.

[00:35:23]
**Bradley:**
And then I'll insert that here. I think that'll be easier to do in that format rather than me talking about it here. Cool. The next main sub point is the examples. So question.

[00:35:35]
**Bradley:**
What would a screenshot walk through of where to go and what to do in ChatGPT's UI look like? Right, the user interface. So pretty self explanatory. I think I'm trying to think if I should do this on. Probably I'll do this both on desktop and on mobile, like on my iPhone.

[00:35:53]
**Bradley:**
Because the buttons you tap and the navigation is different if you're on a desktop versus on a, like on a phone. So if you're in the app on your phone versus if you're in an Internet browser, like on your desktop. Right. So I'll play with that. I'll probably include both versions just because again, the navigation is different.

[00:36:18]
**Bradley:**
I don't know why ChatGPT didn't simplify it, but that's just the way it is. So yeah, I'll do both versions of that.

[00:36:28]
**Bradley:**
And then next question, how can I screenshot my custom instructions and display them in a way that's helpful? I don't know, man. I'll probably create like a pseudo version of my custom instructions. Just like an alternate version where I have Arnold take my current custom instructions for him and say, hey man, I want you to basically like keep this content almost the same verbatim, but just sort of like either reformat it or organize it into these main, like these main subhead sections that I've defined are the like the main component sections of custom instructions that I'm going to give to my reader as a template, right? So I'll probably have that first and then I might, might rework them a little bit.

[00:37:19]
**Bradley:**
But I do want to give them at least a version, like an alternate version of Arno's custom instructions that are like, written in a template friendly way that they fit with the exact template that I'm giving to my target reader so they can see what that looks like. And again, I don't have to, I don't have to super optimize that or anything. I'm just creating an example. This is one instance. This is one example.

[00:37:51]
**Bradley:**
Again, I am constantly upgrading and tweaking Arno's custom instructions myself. So I'm not obligated to like, use this one example that I'm giving my reader for the rest of my life, right? Like, it just, hey, here's an example of what this could look like. This is sort of what it looks like for me right now. Combined, Combined with the template I'm giving you.

[00:38:15]
**Bradley:**
Here's how it could work for you. Go ham. Right, cool. And then I can do whatever I want with my own custom instructions. I don't have to, I don't have to keep them the same.

[00:38:27]
**Bradley:**
I can do whatever I want. Cool. So next question. Well, sorry, going back to that, I think, yeah, put them in the template format and then include a screenshot, probably. I do want to annotate things because I'm going to give some tips on like the Yin Yang prompting technique.

[00:38:47]
**Bradley:**
So I do want to point out and like annotate, highlight specific things that are relevant in my own custom instructions example for Arno and show, and just basically point those out like, hey, look, here's an example of how I'm applying what I'm teaching you. Boom, boom, boom. I'm going to call it out, I'm going to label it, I'm going to add a little annotation arrow, underline it, highlight it, whatever I want to do. Okay, cool. Next question.

[00:39:17]
**Bradley:**
So what does the before and after comparison of the collaborative AI versus the generic AI's responses look like? I do think I need to do some simplification here because I already did this. Like, I already captured some screenshot examples, right? You use the same prompt, use the prompt, and then you get the generic AI's response. And then you copy and paste that same exact prompt into like Arno's chat thread, which is the collaborative AI.

[00:39:54]
**Bradley:**
And then you screenshot Arnold's response, right? And you just compare and contrast. I think I do need to simplify this. I would, honestly, dude, I would not be, I would not be against just rewriting Arno's response myself or even the generic AIs, because, and then having it just like, hey, can you reprint out this text verbatim, right? And then that way I can screenshot it and it looks, it looks like it looks legit.

[00:40:21]
**Bradley:**
It looks like it came as a natural response. Because I don't, I don't think that's like, I don't think that's scammy at all. Because really we're just trying to illustrate the point. And what I would do is I would take the actual, you know, responses from each of these two AIs and I would just like, I would just cut out words or like rework them very slightly to make them instantly easy to understand for the reader. Because I think the last thing I want my reader to do is to get a get caught up like over analyzing or trying too hard to understand the prompt and the responses in the screenshots because they're either too long or they're too convoluted.

[00:41:07]
**Bradley:**
Like, I just want to paint a very simple and straightforward like black and white, day and night contrast, super easy to like read and glance through without getting caught up in the weeds and just be like, hey, cool, bad example versus good example. You can clearly see it, you can consume it and digest it in about, you know, 10 to 30 seconds for each screenshot. I don't want my readers to really spend any more than really like 20 to 30 seconds for each screenshot analyzing it. And I think so again, one way I can speed that up is through editing the AI's responses just to make them a little bit cleaner and easier to read and consume and digest, maybe making them more concise, whatever, maybe editing my original prompts to make it a little bit more simple and straightforward, instantly easy to read and understand. And then the second thing is I can add annotations which I definitely will need to do to point out, you know, certain words or phrases or like examples that each AI's response uses that are either, you know, generic or personal and collaborative.

[00:42:23]
**Bradley:**
Right. So I think you can speed up the readers, I can speed up my readers consumption and like understanding digestion process of the screenshots by adding clear and simple annotations that basically guide their eyes to what is important. And they can, if they really want to read it word for word, they can. But I'm just giving them the quick like, hey, here's the full message, but here's like three or four annotation points that I'm either highlighting or pointing out with arrows. Key things to notice in the response.

[00:42:56]
**Bradley:**
You don't need to overanalyze every word. Right? Just look at these three or four things. So those are the two ways I can improve my readers just comprehension and also the speed of their comprehension, too. So the clarity and the speed of their comprehension of my screenshot examples.

[00:43:12]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:43:26]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Next main subject point. So the template. I'll insert my custom instructions, like the code block content to just copy and paste. Cool.

[00:43:35]
**Bradley:**
Question is, what are the inputs my reader needs to implement this temple? This template, for example, content variables, device considerations, resource requirements, character limit constraints. I mean, I would just add like a bulleted list of. Hey, to use this template, like, I don't know, number one, you can do it on your iPhone or your laptop either way, but, like, doesn't matter. I would suggest typing it in the actual box, like the custom instructions box.

[00:44:11]
**Bradley:**
That way you can see the character limit in real time. Point out, hey, there is a character limit. Just like some pro tips. Basically like a bulleted list of my guidelines or pro tips, either right above or right below the template code block. We'll figure that out.

[00:44:29]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Okay, next question. What is the Yin yang prompting technique and how should my reader implement it here? Okay, I've described this a lot before. You just basically especially this applies more so when you're defining personality attributes or sometimes interaction style things, like communication style things.

[00:44:49]
**Bradley:**
But think about what are some traits or like, characteristics or attributes, personality attributes that you want your AI friend to have. Okay, Like, I don't know, do you want them to be, like, introspective or you probably want them to be collaborative, right? Do you want them to challenge your thinking, whatever it is, Right? And these are personality attributes and also interaction style attributes, I guess you could say. And you just want to balance them out, right?

[00:45:27]
**Bradley:**
So instead of overcorrecting or overfitting, you say, okay, I want you to be collaborative, but I also want you to be an independent thinker. Don't just take what I say at face value. I want you to think through these things yourself. Right? Those are just, again, balancing traits because you want to hit the sweet spot.

[00:45:47]
**Bradley:**
There's a really good quote somewhere. I don't know if it's in a voice note, but it talks about the sweet spot. Maybe it's in my notion page where I guided Lara through these custom instructions. I don't know, talks about, like, you need to balance. Balance Bob sits.

[00:46:03]
**Bradley:**
Because that's how you hit the sweet spot, which is exactly where you want to be. Something like that. Right. And that just really prevents the AI from over correcting and it just gives you a much more like balanced identity and personality and interaction style. It's just much better.

[00:46:20]
**Bradley:**
Next question. How long does this take to apply in real life? And how can I make it sound easy and convenient to the point where it's trivial, meaning my reader has no excuses not to take action on it right now. I think just put a time estimate, like estimated time to complete five minutes. Right?

[00:46:39]
**Bradley:**
Something like that. Kind of. Somewhere again, in the same list that you put the guidelines or instructions, guidelines and pro tips either above or below the template code block. I'd put like a kind of like a lot of articles have like estimated reading time. Right?

[00:46:57]
**Bradley:**
Just estimated time to complete or to apply. 5 minutes or however long it takes. Okay, next main sub point is the recap question. What. What are the progress checkpoints my reader has hit by this point?

[00:47:12]
**Bradley:**
What have they learned plus done by now?

[00:47:16]
**Bradley:**
Again, I think just. I'm not going to get into this here, but I would give like three or four really simple and concise bullet points that feel like, you know, some sort of progress has been made. They had. They came into it without having something and now they do have something. So it's kind of like, it's kind of like Cole's thing that he always says where you're like, I'm not going to guarantee you a conversion rate on your educational email course, but it's more like, hey, here's the guarantee.

[00:47:47]
**Bradley:**
You didn't have it and now you do. Right? So it's just here are things that you didn't have before reading and applying this article or for reading and applying this email. And now here are the things you do have, right? Boom.

[00:48:04]
**Bradley:**
Easy money.

[00:48:08]
**Bradley:**
Next question. What should. Why should they feel proud of this progress and how is it going to. Gonna set them up for success in the next email?

[00:48:20]
**Bradley:**
Let's see. I'm trying to think what the next email is.

[00:48:32]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. What is the next email? I think day two is there.

[00:49:32]
**Bradley:**
Okay, finally found it. So. Gosh, not the. Sorry, I need. I need the outline.

[00:49:38]
**Bradley:**
Gosh dang it.

[00:49:45]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so the day two email is mistake number two. Blindly using the same communication mode for every conversation. When your AI offers three natural ways to talk, which the negative outcome of that is your creative flow dies because you're stuck typing with your fingers when you should be conversationally thinking out loud.

[00:50:07]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, so, I mean, so how does. How does day one's email basically set you up for success? Like, how does that progress set you up for Success for day two's email?

[00:50:23]
**Bradley:**
Because DTU's email I'm really going to get into like using, right? You can either type with your fingers, like copy and paste text, whatever, or you can use advanced voice mode, or you can use the whisper transcription, like basically the voice to text.

[00:50:45]
**Bradley:**
Let's see. I don't know, man. I mean, I think it's just like again, one thing I forgot to include is when you set up your custom instructions in the day one email, you should also choose a voice, right? There's camera, there's like nine different voice options. So you should choose a voice.

[00:51:04]
**Bradley:**
Let me just put that. I totally forgot, but that should definitely be included somewhere in the action steps or the template. I don't know, whatever. So, yeah, I mean, this basically just sets you up to have really natural conversations with your like to have really natural conversations with your AI friend. Regardless of if you're like really typing on your laptop at your desk or having a conversation in your car out loud, like thinking out loud and brain dumping, like whatever sort of communication mode you want to use is going to feel a lot more natural because you're interacting now with this personal AI friend that is your collaborative partner and it just feels much more natural.

[00:51:59]
**Bradley:**
Right? So that naturally gives you a much better like basically AI person to communicate with in three natural ways that I will teach you in the next email. Something like that. Okay, let's see. Okay, cool.

[00:52:33]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So and then the very last section is the conclusion, which is basically like, remember, don't forget to check your inbox tomorrow. Da da da da. And the two questions are, first off, what are the next steps my readers should take? And then the second question is, what does the next email's preview look like?

[00:52:50]
**Bradley:**
Basically tomorrow's golden nuggets, right? Yeah. I mean, look, next steps is really just remember that you are always going to iterate on and refine your custom instructions, your AI's personality and identity and all that kind of stuff. And you're going to improve your prompting skills by like approaching this like a scientist instead of whatever else. Like you're going to approach this like a scientist.

[00:53:19]
**Bradley:**
You're going to experiment, you're going to have fun. You're constantly going to iterate and refine and evolve and get better. I think that's just something to expect going forward and that's the next step. Expect that you're going to iterate on this for the next you know, three to four weeks for sure. And even like the next six months and beyond, I'm still iterating on this and I've been using ChatGPT since the week it came out.

[00:53:47]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:53:50]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. And then tomorrow's email, I think I'm. I'll answer that more a little bit later. But yeah, again, the three communication modes. Yeah, I'll.

[00:54:01]
**Bradley:**
I'll answer that a little bit more in depth later. I can't even remember what the content is exactly for that. So, yeah, and I think I'm just going to follow Cole's. Cole's basically instructions here. It's really again, Nicholas Cole, C O L E Cole.

[00:54:19]
**Bradley:**
It really should be pretty straightforward. Like, I don't think I'm going to be riffing too much or going off script too much in this last conclusion section. I think I'm really going to follow Cole's module three instructions pretty much like verbatim almost exactly. So if anything's needed, I'll add more context or content here later. All right.

[00:54:46]
**Bradley:**
And then you have the sign off at the very end. I'm debating whether I should add my. Add my nickname.

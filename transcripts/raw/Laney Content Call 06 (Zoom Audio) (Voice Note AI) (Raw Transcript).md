[00:01:57]
**Laney:**
Well the next. The first group was two weeks ago. And then I have a new group coming tomorrow. Well the same group but they all live in different states. So it's not like they can just come over after work. So it's like a two hour to four hour drive. So they're all driving up with their vehicles and trucks and equipment. And then I think we're going to put in 40 posts tomorrow. You should see me drive a big ass tractor. Like big. Like the wheels are taller than me.

[00:02:25]
**Bradley:**
Huh. Wow.

[00:02:28]
**Laney:**
It's impressive. I think your dad would be jealous because remember how he was about the lawnmower?

[00:02:33]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:02:34]
**Laney:**
This might be one of those things.

[00:02:36]
**Bradley:**
It might be. I'm not sure. Yeah.

[00:02:38]
**Laney:**
Maybe you might want to let them know.

[00:02:40]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:02:41]
**Laney:**
I was trusted to drive 150000 tractor.

[00:02:45]
**Bradley:**
Wow. That's pretty.

[00:02:48]
**Laney:**
I kind of felt bad. Like a badass. Not bad. I didn't feel bad. I felt like. So anyway we're gonna do finish that we got 100 holes in. We're gonna do another 40. So. Why are we yawning? Did we just wake up?

[00:03:02]
**Bradley:**
I did wake up from a nap.

[00:03:04]
**Laney:**
You have tired eyes. I can see your eyes had a little nap.

[00:03:08]
**Bradley:**
So. But we're good.

[00:03:10]
**Laney:**
Naps are fun. As long as this isn't you just waking up for the morning. We'd have to have a talk.

[00:03:14]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:03:16]
**Laney:**
Is this you waking up for the morning?

[00:03:18]
**Bradley:**
No, it's just a little nap time.

[00:03:20]
**Laney:**
So that's okay because you're calling me during my nap time.

[00:03:25]
**Bradley:**
So yeah. Okay.

[00:03:27]
**Laney:**
I'm ready. I'm ready. I was kind of avoiding it because I'm so tired. Let me just check one message that came through really quick to make sure I. I don't miss a client.

[00:03:36]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:03:36]
**Laney:**
Angela. Hi. Lady is still to get it will be 3:15. Are you kidding me? Can we do 3:30? Can we do 3:30 in Zoom call. Damn. This is how my. This is how my whole day has been. Every time I try to do something something else happens. Okay. We won't may only be able to get one done. I'm ready to go.

[00:04:03]
**Bradley:**
That's fine. So which. Which one do you want to do?

[00:04:06]
**Laney:**
What do you want to do?

[00:04:07]
**Bradley:**
The.

[00:04:12]
**Laney:**
The volunteers.

[00:04:14]
**Bradley:**
Volunteers one.

[00:04:15]
**Laney:**
Okay.

[00:04:16]
**Bradley:**
Am I echoing a little bit or is what see? Nope. Okay.

[00:04:19]
**Laney:**
I may Switch back. Back and forth between conversations on this text message.

[00:04:24]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so let's see what I was gonna say. Okay, so what. So for this one, what do you want the main focus to be? Like, what's the.

[00:04:36]
**Laney:**
Thank you appreciation? I don't know. Just a little bit about the storm. So there's a historical event there. Like, we need a little bit of a historical event. Then with the reaction of the clients when they couldn't get a hold of me, when I kind of went offline completely, their care and concern. And then. So I think the storm, the reality of the storm, the care and concern of others that couldn't get a hold of me during the storm or saw that I was offline, and then the reaction of the clients when I came back online, their love, their care, their concern, and their. I don't want. I'm trying to think of the word. Something to help. Their not ability to help, but just their willingness to help me. It was just overwhelming. Like. Like. You ready for this? More than I've seen.

[00:05:48]
**Bradley:**
What's up?

[00:05:49]
**Laney:**
More than I've ever seen in my life. In the church.

[00:05:52]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:05:53]
**Laney:**
It's a good thing because it's good to see that there's good everywhere. I mean, we don't. That's not in my article, but I'm just saying we're so surrounded by it in our element. But it's so. It was so amazing to see between you and I. Didn't matter what you were. It didn't matter where you came from. It didn't matter. It just. The true. The true care and concern, not because you're supposed to, but because you care, was amazing.

[00:06:22]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha.

[00:06:23]
**Laney:**
Yeah. But that's just between you and I, so.

[00:06:26]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, that makes sense.

[00:06:27]
**Laney:**
Yeah.

[00:06:29]
**Bradley:**
Cool. So. So, I mean, it could be like three things I'm grateful for that people helped out with or whatever, something along those lines, as far as the. The headline or title goes. Okay, cool. And then what. What are, I guess, some examples of those things that you wanted.

[00:06:49]
**Laney:**
Do we want to talk about the events leading up to it? A little paragraph on that. You know, like, on such and such day, Hurricane Helene was predicted to make landfall. And nobody anticipated that the force of what it would do going up into the mountains, because hurricanes are usually on coastlines. And the fact of it turning into a tropical storm, the size of this storm was here. Dang. It was. Nobody. They didn't prepare for it basically caught everybody with their pants down. Nobody prepared for it. Did you get my message? No, I didn't. Okay. I'm just getting off a zoom call. Let me see if I can postpone him and then I'll come right out. Okay. Let me just anyway find the day that it. So nobody here was prepared for it. There was no warning systems. We just thought it was going to be another big rainstorm, like, oh, we're going to get a lot of rain. And the reality was devastation like this country's never seen. And so, I mean, if you've seen the notice. So I prepared. I prepared like I would for a large storm. And I did prepare for a flood because we had one, two, three years earlier. So I prepared. But even with all the preparations that I made, you know, in case of emergency, it still wouldn't have worked for me. You know, like I was going to move the dogs in the basement. It's a flood. If the barn got flooded and my basement got flooded so I couldn't move. I mean I did my. The water didn't hit come to my house, but the septic is. Was in the river. Like the septic. The water came high into my fields and went into my septic tank and pushed all the water from my septic into my basement. The pressure was so hard that it pushed the water uphill into my house. And so me tell having the dogs go into the house for an emergency couldn't happen because my whole basement was flooded.

[00:09:09]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:09:09]
**Laney:**
And then the plant second plan was to put the dogs, take them up to Jody's house. Well, telephone lines and trees blocked her road. And then I was surrounded and I couldn't leave my driveway because my driveway was a river. So I was on this little island.

[00:09:25]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:09:26]
**Laney:**
So I need to find a different way to prepare if this happens again. So in all the preparation and I'm just an example and I was preparing, but most of them didn't. So came. It was huge. And we lost power, we lost Internet. We lost a lot of stuff. But then in, in that just the aftermath of the communities that were affected and towns gone that'll never rebuild, just all of that was so huge. So then being offline, when I finally was able to get back online, I had clients that reported me missing. I had clients do a proof of life where you could call one company that would call, not like a one service that would call somebody. And then they come and they walk to you and find you and knock on your door and ask you if you are who you are. And they say, we just need to know a proof of life. It was all my clients that did these things put me on Missing persons report reached out to people through the Internet. One lady investigated where I went to high school tried to reach out to there. I mean they were all trying to find if I was okay, which was amazing. And I've got like 10 stories like that, you know, so those are just some of the things that apples. I have to go do this thing. I have to go out there. They're here. All right, so we're going to end there. When can I call you back?

[00:10:56]
**Bradley:**
What do you want to do?

[00:10:57]
**Laney:**
So popular and stuff now?

[00:10:59]
**Bradley:**
What's that?

[00:11:01]
**Laney:**
You're getting so popular that you know, what's your, what's your timeline?

[00:11:05]
**Bradley:**
What's that? Oh yeah. So what's did you want. Is there any time later today or do you want to do tomorrow or what's, What's.

[00:11:12]
**Laney:**
No, I can't do it tomorrow because all the volunteers. I'm gonna have to do it later. So let me. It's gonna have to be like it.

[00:11:17]
**Bradley:**
I mean we could do Saturday, we could do Monday.

[00:11:20]
**Laney:**
No, I have, I have, I, I have volunteers Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. So can we do tonight like at 7:30 my time? That's 5:30 your time? Sure.

[00:11:31]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I think it's 4:30 my time.

[00:11:35]
**Laney:**
Is that okay?

[00:11:36]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, sure.

[00:11:38]
**Laney:**
Well, you know what, I can do it in an, in an hour and a half. 4:30. I can do it at 5:30 my time. 5:30.

[00:11:49]
**Bradley:**
Okay, that's what, your time?

[00:11:52]
**Laney:**
So I'm going to text you at 5:30. You're going to send me a link at 5:30.

[00:11:56]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:11:56]
**Laney:**
I'm very sorry. This is the, this is one of the fencing companies and I need to. Sorry.

[00:12:04]
**Bradley:**
All right, sounds good. I'll call you back at 5:30.

[00:12:07]
**Laney:**
All right, see you. Bye.

[00:12:08]
**Bradley:**
All right, bye. It tired back again.

[00:15:12]
**Laney:**
I'm so tired. I'm so tired.

[00:15:16]
**Bradley:**
It's all good. I am too.

[00:15:19]
**Laney:**
What are you gonna do today?

[00:15:20]
**Bradley:**
How the, How'd the fencing go?

[00:15:24]
**Laney:**
It's good. He just talks really fast like. So here's what I'm doing. I'm gonna go take the wire. I'm gonna circle back around here. Do you see that corner? We're gonna circle right there. And then I've got to come in and I gotta tie it in. Can you see what I'm saying? And I just said I can't commit to that. Put it on paper. Yeah, because he wants me to see what he's seen. And I says, last time I listened to your brain. I'm not saying it's wrong. I picture I pictured something Different. So you have to put on paper. How come you can't see it? Can't you see it? Like, you know, we're talking about 30 different loops and he wants me to see it and I'm like, I'm done.

[00:16:06]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:16:07]
**Laney:**
So, yeah, he's very nice, but he exhausts me. So now I'm really tired because it's like, I'll draw your picture and send it. Okay. I think, I don't know what I want to talk about diverting down the Christmas puppies. Now we're gonna do Christmas puppy. Let's keep going with the storm.

[00:16:28]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:16:29]
**Laney:**
So I think. Okay. I think about being a quality breeder also means being a quality friend and being there for your clients to answer all the questions of their customers. And I've always felt that that's very important, that they feel comfortable to call me or text me or email me when they have a concern, a question, a fear, anything. I need to be there for them. And that's always been my mantra. And I never knew that that would turn around and come back to, I don't want to use the word bless because I needed to be very neutral, religious wise. But I never knew it would come back and pay it back to me. You know, I, I. And it did by the amount of care that these people give to me and are still giving to me. So my philosophy in breeding was, was different than most breeders. It's more time consuming, it's more labor intensive. But in the end, you make friends. Your friends become like family, and they care for, they care for you as a person and they care for your dogs that you're still breeding. And so that was really the neat thing that came out of that. Even though the storm was there and it was scary and there was devastation happening when my phone turned on and all the messages that came in was overwhelming. Like, holy crap. You know, people care.

[00:18:20]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:18:20]
**Laney:**
And they don't care that they actually took time to care for me. And that was. I get. I want to talk about that in this post because I, I think there's a good story to it. And the story isn't about me. It's about how kind these people were. I don't want the story to be about me. I want it to be about the kindness of things that different people did. So I got this today and I wanted to read it because I'd like it to be quoted in. It's a little bit about me. But the way she writes is really, really nice. And I'm going to get her Permission. So this is one of my clients and she said this is Sully and me watching your video the other morning. This text is overdue and I have written you in my mind so many times. I wish I could count them. I have never been more overjoyed than when I saw your posts after the storm. So thankful for all. So thankful that all were okay. I have been so thankful for all that stepped up to help you rebuild. It is amazing to think how far you have come. We are happy to be able to contribute through GoFundMe. Thank you for the one. Thank you. The one who set that up so quickly. I know this hasn't been easy. Have prayed over you a lot. And Sully, that's her dog, and I watch puppy videos together. He's so funny when he hears the barks, he hears the dogs barking in your voice. It's as though he truly remembers. I was. I was reminded why I wanted one of your dogs. As I watched the people that showed up to help, I was reminded of why I followed you as a breeder long before I contacted you. You are resilient, strong woman with a heart for her animals like none other that I have seen. I have watched you with these new puppies and I loved and I see the love and care you pour into each puppy and each mom. I'm just so thankful for our precious Sully and her dog. I am so thankful for your foresight in matching us with him. I'm just especially thankful for you and that God spared your farm in the midst of a lot of devastation so that you can keep doing what you do so well. May he go before you now as you rebuild. And may all of the precious new pups find their forever homes quickly. Please give my love to Jody and Sharon. Just hope one day to get a hug. To be able to get to hug you again, Marian. And so I would like that included because she says it all.

[00:20:57]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:20:58]
**Laney:**
Like she says it all. Like this is how all of she says very nice things about me. And I get that. But this is the response that I had from numerous of people. Like they were just so genuinely concerned. I mean this doesn't go in thing. They're more concerned with my own family.

[00:21:17]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:21:18]
**Laney:**
And it was heartfelt so in those concerns within. Within days of finding out I was okay. A go. One of my clients asked permission to set up a GoFundMe. Within 10 days, they had raised over $9,000 for me to rebuild the fence. An organization of people came to my house and brought all of their Tools and stayed for two days, and they drove as far as, you know, two to six miles, two to six hours away to come and help and stay here and. And build. And no, we didn't get it done. And when they came, the man and the man who was overseeing it just says, lainey, this isn't going to be done. It's going to take months. Like, the devastation of your fencing is going to take months. So. And, you know, but. And my heart just sank like, oh, no. And the next thing out of his mouth was, but don't worry, we'll come back and get it finished. And they are. And they're going to come back again and again and again. And they live in a different state. And so it's those things. It's those customers. They thank me for giving them a dog. I thank them for making it so that I can continue my business. Because without that fence, I have no business. I have no business. So I want the post to be a big thank you to them. With the examples of love. With the examples of. I was on the missing persons list. People going and sending out for a proof of life where they come knock on your door. People that contacted through a chain of people. This person knew. This person that knew. Knew of me, who knew a person who they've never met, who talked on the Internet back and forth to let them know that somebody had seen me alive. And she went through, like, 10 people. So it's those stories, because we hear all the stories of devastation, we hear all the stories of death, we hear all the stories of tragedy, and they are there. They're horrible. This is not to go in the story, but last week, one of the search and rescues, they were interviewing him. He says, I was trying to get a guy during the rescue, and he was up to his neck in mud, and he just said, just let me die. Just let me die. My wife is underneath me, and she let go hours ago. Yeah. I mean, those are the stories we are hearing daily. And so I want a story of the resilience of these people that are just so good. Money that was donated. Yeah. You know, so it was. Yeah, just. It was just amazing. And so I. That's kind of what I want it to be. I want it to be a big thank you. So if you have questions you want to ask that will help put that story together, we can do that. But that's kind of the basis of what I'm looking for.

[00:24:21]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, no, that makes sense. I mean, I think you could frame it as like, three examples of things I'm grateful for during this time or whatever. So.

[00:24:32]
**Laney:**
But, yeah, like gratitude in the midst of a tragedy, you know. Okay.

[00:24:38]
**Bradley:**
Something like that. So, yeah, I can put that together. And then. Did you want to do the. The second post, too?

[00:24:45]
**Laney:**
Well, I want. Do you have questions for this one like you do on the others? Where's your questions, Bradley? Where's my interview? Where's my interview? You're having a date you're not on today?

[00:24:58]
**Bradley:**
No, I think I can reshape that into something. It's just. Yeah. Anyway, I didn't really plan interview questions for. For that one because I wasn't sure what direction you wanted to go until now.

[00:25:10]
**Laney:**
Okay. So if you want to even. If you want to even pick out questions later, you can. Or if you want to go through, I don't know, some of the old posts. You'll see some of the things that people did for me, you know, like on the old Instagram stuff. I don't know if you've been following, you know, I don't know. I know that I kept a daily journal, a video journal, when I had no electricity, no Internet, you know, and just of what it was like. But, yeah, it was kind of like being on an island. What people don't understand is this. And, like, especially the west, they don't understand when they say North Carolina, people think the ocean, like, oh, a tragedy hit the ocean. Well, the tragedy hit the ocean in Florida, came straight up and hit the mountains of North Carolina. And our mountains are. I can't even compare any of the mountains that you've seen in. In Nevada. But if you went up to Utah and you look at the top of those mountains, Wake up, Wake up. And you look at your seats, and there was a little town of Provo nestled in the top of one crest of a mountain. And then you go over to, like, Timpanogos, and there's another town crested over there.

[00:26:34]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:26:34]
**Laney:**
And all these little crests and so. And then it washes out the roads, and these people are stranded in these little pockets of the mountains. And that's why the rescues have been so hard, is because this isn't like going into a city and finding a way around the roads and things that you. Literally, the mountains have been destroyed by logs and roads. Like, the i40 is gone. The i40 goes all the way across the United States, and there's a big piece of it missing. They've closed it. It's off the Google Maps. That's huge.

[00:27:06]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:27:07]
**Laney:**
There's over 9,000 roads that have been closed down and affected from the storm just in our North Carolina, our area. So people don't understand the concept of destruction is huge. So anyway, that's the deal. That's my story. I can tell you're really tired. You're struggling today. What's going on? You're struggling. Talk to me. Talk to me, Bradley. You're not your happy self. What's happening?

[00:27:32]
**Bradley:**
No, I'm good.

[00:27:34]
**Laney:**
You know, you can talk to me.

[00:27:36]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, no, that's good. I think. I think I'll have enough stuff to put that together and I can ask you some follow up questions if I need to on that one. But then look at me.

[00:27:47]
**Laney:**
I'm worried about you. What's going on?

[00:27:49]
**Bradley:**
No, I'm.

[00:27:49]
**Laney:**
I'm good. Are you sad? Are you depressed?

[00:27:52]
**Bradley:**
No, I'm fine.

[00:27:54]
**Laney:**
You're such a liar. That was not even honest.

[00:27:57]
**Bradley:**
I'm fine. A little bit of digestive issues today, but other than that, that's fine.

[00:28:03]
**Laney:**
Just that. That's okay. That's fine. Okay, well, you can always tell me I don't feel good or I'm having a bad day or life sucks. It doesn't bother me.

[00:28:12]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, no, I'm good overall though, so.

[00:28:15]
**Laney:**
Okay. Are you happy?

[00:28:17]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, of course.

[00:28:18]
**Laney:**
Are you?

[00:28:18]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:28:20]
**Laney:**
You don't just say that just to say it, do you? No. Okay.

[00:28:25]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:28:25]
**Laney:**
Because if you ask me if I was happy and I wasn't, I would tell you it wasn't. Yeah, but that's okay. All right, well, I'm proud of you. I think you do a fantastic job. I know it's very hard to find your place in the world and find a place in a niche market of life and what do we do when we're supposed to have a career and blah.

[00:28:46]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, for sure.

[00:28:47]
**Laney:**
It's hard. Yeah, it is. It's hard. I'm reinventing myself. You kidding me? I was a realtor and I owned a bookkeeping company and now I'm doing dogs. It's just like. Just reinvent and so if I can do it, anybody can do it. So just. And you're young and you've got a good thing going, so don't get discouraged.

[00:29:08]
**Bradley:**
Oh, definitely.

[00:29:10]
**Laney:**
Okay. All right, let's just work on that for now because my bandwidth is pretty, pretty low.

[00:29:16]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool.

[00:29:18]
**Laney:**
I probably should go have some more sugar.

[00:29:20]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, probably. I'll speed you back up.

[00:29:24]
**Laney:**
Yes. All right, thanks.

[00:29:28]
**Bradley:**
Of course. I'll let you know if I have any follow up questions and then. And then, yeah, we can go from there.

[00:29:35]
**Laney:**
Okay. Talk to you later.

[00:29:37]
**Bradley:**
All right, sweet. Thanks, Laney.

[00:29:38]
**Laney:**
See you bye.

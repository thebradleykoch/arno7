# ðŸ“ˆ Rapid Lessons Learned & EEC Writing Approach Upgrades (Voice Note AI) (Raw Transcript)

[00:00:05]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. So let's see. It's actually a little bit chillier than I anticipated out here. Probably should have brought another jacket, but yeah, let's see. So.

[00:00:37]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. So I just basically I wanted to make a quick note on, I think. So let me just do a table of contents real quick. Just overview of topics. So earlier today I was really, really struggling with.

[00:01:09]
**Bradley:**
I felt like I was super knee deep and up close, like in the technical details and in the weeds of trying to figure out how the heck do I like how the heck do I use Cole's 1, 3, 1 writing rhythm. And then also like a rhetorical structure prompt template. And then also what else, like self prompt interview questions. How do I basically, you know, combine those three together? And then I was dealing with a lot of like, just internal doubt and almost self esteem challenges of like, man, I haven't actually written like as a human being in like full form in a long time.

[00:02:02]
**Bradley:**
Like probably since, I mean not since college for sure, but like I haven't written anything that I genuinely, I guess, feel proud of and feel like it represents my personal style and voice probably since the Liberty Tribune in high high school. So anyway, I dug up some of those. I dug up like five high school newspaper articles I wrote just to kind of like rediscover or recapture what my own writing style looks like, what my own voice looks like. And anyway, that's not the whole point of this voice note. I guess what I want to share is how I basically what I learned from coming really, really close with the technical details in the weeds, really having a hard time of being able to connect these things because the approach was just off, right?

[00:03:06]
**Bradley:**
Like the angle. The angle or the order or whatever was just off. And then now what I am pivoting to that actually makes way more sense just in terms of doing this. And I think part of the discovery that I had today was so I was writing Laney's blog post. I think it's blog post seven or blog post eight.

[00:03:30]
**Bradley:**
I think it's blog post seven. But anyway, regardless, it's the one that's like three surprising benefits of bringing a puppy home at Christmas time and how to create memories that last something like that. I think that's headline. And so basically, and it's actually a really good thing that I wrote that newsletter with Arno today because I think this sort of was the catalyst or trigger for my breakthrough to like help me pivot out of the mental chasm where I was stuck seeing things up too close. So I think Basically what happened was I, yet again, like, went into writing Latent east newsletter.

[00:04:27]
**Bradley:**
Everything was great all the way up to, you know, like, the prep to page variables was great. The main points and sub points, which is the brain dump, bullseye method, that was all great, right? But then once we hit the, like, once we hit the prep, the page outline where we actually like, plug those main points and sub points in and sort of hash out what the skeleton looks like with, you know, some bullet points and subheads filled in, I was starting to realize. I was like, okay, well, looking at the next step, which is basically expand this outline into a full post using a rhetorical structure. I was like, the rhetorical structure that I have currently in my notion doc that I've used for, like most of her other blog posts.

[00:05:23]
**Bradley:**
Just right off the bat reading it, I'm like, this is not conducive. Like, this is just not work. Because the newsletter I'm writing, right, that I was writing today was much more of a. Hey, here are some, like, personal stories about how I got, you know, one of my favorite or like, first puppies during Christmas, right? That's was Laney.

[00:05:44]
**Bradley:**
She was sharing, here's my personal story. And then here are, you know, the benefits of getting a puppy at Christmas time as opposed to any other time of year. And then here are the. Here are basically like some tips and some examples, right? So, like, some tips and examples of how you can create a memorable experience, right?

[00:06:11]
**Bradley:**
So I think the core, the core elements were really like, you had, okay, in the headline, you had benefits, right? That's one of the proven approaches. So you had the three benefits. But then the way that we were expanding that was, okay, we're using a personal story, actually a few different personal stories or like, you know, a main personal story, and then a few personal anecdotes. And then we're also using tips, examples, right?

[00:06:38]
**Bradley:**
And my original rhetorical structure prompt was much more, like, much more oriented around problem and solution. And it was much more oriented around, hey, in the first sentence, we're going to call out a myth or mistake or misconception that the reader has, and we're going to, you know, empathize with them, but then show them that it's not true and we're going to show them a better way, right? So the original rhetorical structure was much more framed around overcoming myths, mistakes, objections, you know, faulty beliefs, limiting beliefs, old perspectives and old POVs, and basically reframing the mindset and the understanding. And anyway, like, it did implement some sort of you know, tips or examples. But it wasn't.

[00:07:37]
**Bradley:**
Basically, it was just not a fit. It was just not a fit for the newsletter I was writing. And I've come across this multiple times where it's like, okay, I'm trying to create a universal rhetorical structure template just doesn't work. And so what I'm realizing is, like. And this makes so much sense, though, dude, because it's like, okay, with Cole and Dickey, like, you might have, let's say you have the four different types of EECs, four different types of educational email courses, which are, I think it's the biggest mistakes.

[00:08:09]
**Bradley:**
Eec, the crash course eec. The templates are like actionable templates, eec, and then like the step by step guide eec. I could be wrong, but I think that's what it is. So each One of those EECs is basically a theme. And when you look at those, it's like each day's email has the same, I guess, the same proven approaches, the same elements, the same rhetorical structure components, and even rhetorical, Even rhetorical moves and rhetorical directives.

[00:08:47]
**Bradley:**
Because each day's email, which is essentially a blog post, always, it fits within that overarching theme, right? It is a part of a larger whole. Right? And so what I could say for Laney's blog post is like, okay, well, any newsletter or blog post I write for Laney that is targeted at, like, educating the customer about a problem or a bad habit or a mistake, or like an old, like a faulty belief myth, mistake, limiting mindset, whatever, concern, objection. And then reframing it too.

[00:09:27]
**Bradley:**
Okay, here's. Here's now the. The new correct way to think about it. Here's the new pov, like, and here's some tips and examples of how to do that. Whatever.

[00:09:38]
**Bradley:**
Those all fall within one category. And I would say you could label this the, like, problem solution category, or you could even label it. I think that, like, the sort of the cousin or even the sibling would be mistake and how to fix it. Right? Mistake is essentially a problem, and then how to fix it is essentially the solution.

[00:10:03]
**Bradley:**
Right? So anyway, I think this is a big pattern recognition thing where I'm sort of learning, okay, where are the boundaries between, you know, these different themed newsletters? And within each theme, you can use essentially the same rhetorical structure, but once you venture outside of that theme, outside of that package, so to speak, then you have to make adjustments.

[00:10:31]
**Bradley:**
And I think, anyway, and I was really frustrated with this because it took me, like, honestly, it took me way longer than it should probably took me, like four or five hours to write this dang newsletter. I just did not know what to do when I realized the rhetorical structure from past. From past newsletters is not going to work. And so I basically, I just threw my old rhetorical structure to Arno, and I was like, hey, man, look, this doesn't. Like.

[00:10:59]
**Bradley:**
This is a good example of a rhetorical structure prompt, but this is not gonna, like, totally work for our current newsletter. It's just kind of a different type or different theme. So what are the parts that you think we could keep and adopt, but then what are the parts you think we need to tweak? Right. And so anyway, with Arno, I basically combined.

[00:11:20]
**Bradley:**
I basically converted or transformed that to a new rhetorical structure template, and we combined that with Nicholas Cole's. I think it was. It wasn't his. Well, his 1,3 1 writing rhythm framework for the introduction, but then for the main points, and here's a key distinction. I don't know why I didn't realize this later.

[00:11:40]
**Bradley:**
I just didn't scroll further, far enough down in his book called the Art and Business of Online Writing. But main points, you're more typically going to follow a. I think it's like a. It's either a 13521 structure or like a. I think it might even be like a 1, 2, 521-253-1252, 1.

[00:12:06]
**Bradley:**
Something like that, man. I think it's 12531 something. Something along those lines. And anyway, that made it a lot easier where I was like, okay, now I'm not constrained to the One3One writing framework because it actually makes sense for a main point. Like, you need more sentences, so you need a.

[00:12:24]
**Bradley:**
Like a. A bigger. A bigger container, a bigger writing rhythm for those. So anyway, that. That really worked, and we were able to make a rhetorical structure prompt template combined with Nicholas Cole's writing rhythms.

[00:12:41]
**Bradley:**
You know, each writing rhythm that matched the section. And honestly, dude, like, it worked really well. Honestly worked pretty well. I also did again, the step where I basically had Arno study first the rhetorical structure prompts template and just sort of do a thinking step where he would match each rhetorical move or directive with some sort of content from the prep, the page outline or the actual client content call, interview transcript. So he had an example that he knew he was going to pair or match up with each, like, each line or each section, Right?

[00:13:20]
**Bradley:**
And then before he drafted anything, I just said, okay, cool, now I want you to go and, like, Basically create your own study style guide. I didn't do this step outside. I was just too lazy. I was like, I'm not going to go create a style guide outside of this. I'm like, all right, I'll just go right now.

[00:13:35]
**Bradley:**
Study these three or four blog posts from your project knowledge base. And I want you to extract like two or three attributes for style, tone and voice with examples from Laney's previous blog post. And then after that, I want you to do a thinking step for how you can basically, basically, like, execute this rhetorical structure in a way that matches up with the prep the page outline and is written in Laney's own style, tone and voice without, like creating too much repetition or redundancies. Right. Anyway, I was recapping.

[00:14:18]
**Bradley:**
That seemed to work pretty dang well. So I need to sort of smooth that out and just make it into a smoother prompt chain. But anyway, bigger point being, I think so. I know that's kind of like a, like in depth documentation journal entry, but I want to say I think the main point that I learned is, okay, the rhetorical structure template is very important and like, that makes a big difference when writing with AI. But you can't rely on one universal version.

[00:14:59]
**Bradley:**
You need to know, like, as a human, how to mix and match specific, like, key sections and also like, elements. Where if, for example, like on level, let's say level one. Right? Level one, you have a proven approach which is benefits. Right.

[00:15:19]
**Bradley:**
Okay, then you need to know which proven approaches, which proven approach elements match well or pair well with expanding benefits. Right. And for this case, it was personal stories and tips and examples. Right? Like real life examples, helpful, actionable tips.

[00:15:44]
**Bradley:**
And then like real life personal stories and like personal anecdotes, basically. Right. So benefits, stories, tips, examples. It was those four that ended up pairing really well together. And once we sort of established that, like, it was very.

[00:16:03]
**Bradley:**
It's very easy. It's just like, it just made sense. It flowed, it clicked. It's like, okay, cool, this makes sense.

[00:16:13]
**Bradley:**
I think so, yeah. And that was a rhetorical structure prompt template, like a specific combo that I had not created before. Right. Because previously I was mostly locked into the problem, problem, solution or mistake, how to fix it, sort of category or theme. Right.

[00:16:35]
**Bradley:**
And so to just demonstrate what I think this means for me going forward with writing my personal five day educational email course, writing days one through five, like day one email, day two email, all the way through day five. Here's what I realized, because I knew going into this that I was Going that I was wanting to make more of. Not just a basic generic like hey, here's the biggest mistakes category of EEC is more so like, okay, that's how we can start out and sort of present it at the start. But I'm going, I'm going to show you the biggest mistakes, the reasons why those things are mistakes or the reason why those happen and how to fix them. But then I'm also going to go beyond that and basically give you like tangible how to action steps and actual examples of what this looks like in real life and then a template.

[00:17:45]
**Bradley:**
So if you think this makes so much sense, because originally I was trying to write like I was trying to either write on my own, like human mind freestyle, just sort of follow the follow Cole's 1, 3, 1 writing rhythm like framework using basically using like each a little rhetorical move or rhetorical directive as my own self prompt. So it was like, okay, one sentence opener, make a bold declarative statement, whatever or three sentence explainer explanation, explain this or that. And I was just having a really hard time, dude. I'm like, I don't know, like this doesn't make sense. I feel like I don't even have content in my brain that lines up with this.

[00:18:38]
**Bradley:**
Do I need to turn these rhetorical moves or basically like writing rhythm directions into interview questions so that I can spill my unique perspective through a brain dump voice note to like get the content out and then we can map it to that. And it was really frustrating. And I realized I was like, okay, the reason why this isn't working in my mind is because just like in Laney's example, I am like, in my head, I have already envisioned the type of EEC that I want to write. And it is a, it is a different category than just a regular biggest mistakes style eec, right? Because the biggest mistakes style eec, it basically just goes, hey, here's the mistake, here's what it, you know what it looks like, here's an explanation of it.

[00:19:42]
**Bradley:**
Here are the negative outcomes, like here's the reason why this happens and here's how to fix it. And it's just like three quick basic action steps, right? Like not a lot of elaboration. And I'm realizing, okay, well I am more so writing an EEC that represents almost like a course module and it's not entirely right. Like I really need to simplify this and keep it level one difficulty, basically beginner level, strip away any of the complexity and like triage away the more advanced skills because it's just like a high level overview, like really, really quick, hey, get your feet wet kind of deal.

[00:20:24]
**Bradley:**
But a course module has, I guess, different or additional components than just the mistakes EEC does, right? So a course module has. What is it? It's like, I think it's reasons or benefits, right? Like reason, reasons why to do this thing.

[00:20:48]
**Bradley:**
Then it has mistakes and then it has. God, gosh, I can't remember, dude.

[00:21:17]
**Bradley:**
Let's see. So it has, okay, so the five components of a perfect course module. Number one, reasons why, benefits. Number two, mistakes to avoid problems. Number three, steps how to action.

[00:21:34]
**Bradley:**
Number four, commonly asked questions, objections. Number five, walk through example proof. Right? And so I guess just to put this in perspective, like I'm following this a little bit shuffled around. So I'm following this perfect course module, but a little bit shuffled around.

[00:22:02]
**Bradley:**
And I'm also following, I think the easiest framework to follow is the six fundamental building blocks of every book, digital products and course I create by Nicholas Cole, right? Which is again, number one is the thinking, right? Number one is thinking, basically old POV or mindset versus the new pov, the new perspective, the new thinking. Number two is the emotions, right? The old mindset, old status quo, what you're comfortable with.

[00:22:41]
**Bradley:**
And then the new mindset, new status quo. Basically the discomforts that you're gonna have to step up, step up and like step into to adopt the new thinking. And then number three is far out. What is it? Number three is myths, right?

[00:23:03]
**Bradley:**
So this falls under the category of like myths, mistakes, misconceptions. But basically I think you can group these first three together very well. Like number one, the thinking, number two, the emotions, number three, the myths, right? These kind of are their own little group, right? Myths, mistakes, misconceptions.

[00:23:26]
**Bradley:**
So ultimately like when we, when we started this EEC off, we are going to be. It's more. So it follows the six fundamental building blocks framework a little bit closer than this perfect course module framework. I just want to say like basically all of these components or elements within these frameworks, they all overlap. The only difference is that they are shuffled into a slightly different order or structure.

[00:24:02]
**Bradley:**
And then the way that you expand each one might be a little bit different. You might use a different proven approach, a different combination of proven approach elements, right? Because just like red wine pairs better with steak and white wine pairs better with fish. Like some pairings just are more natural and make more sense, right? Just like I described with figuring out a new category or theme for Laney's newsletter with the benefits plus Stories plus tips plus examples like those proven approach elements mesh very well together.

[00:24:54]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, man, I think basically here's how, here's how I'm gonna approach it. I'm gonna use. I'm gonna use Cole's biggest mistakes EEC as basically like as the foundation, right? Like this is lay the groundwork, lay the. Lay the rail railroad track.

[00:25:18]
**Bradley:**
We've got the. Basically the way that goes is intro. That's number one is the intro. Number two, I guess number one is basically the subject line and the preview text, which is kind of like the headline in a newsletter or blog post, right? So number one, subject line and preview text.

[00:25:36]
**Bradley:**
Number two is the intro. That's the first section. That's the first like main section of the email. Number three is the mistake, right? Like what is the mistake?

[00:25:51]
**Bradley:**
What does it look like? Describe it what it looks like in real life. Okay? Number four is the reason why this happens, right? And then number five is.

[00:26:05]
**Bradley:**
And how to fix it, right? And then number six is literally just like tomorrow's email, like next email reminder. This is what to look forward to in your inbox, right? Kind of like a CTA kind of. Not.

[00:26:19]
**Bradley:**
I don't know. And then you have a sign off which I guess is technically a number seven section. But the way that I'm going to adapt that is basically, it's going to look like this. So same exact structure to begin with. We're going to start with the mistake, explain it, describe it using real life examples.

[00:26:48]
**Bradley:**
I think I can sort of decide as I go if I want to use, you know, what sort of style elements or I guess psychology elements and what do you call them? What sort of psychology elements, approach elements, style elements or structure elements. I want to use basically like the method, right? Like the what do you call them? The what.

[00:27:15]
**Bradley:**
I'm trying to think in the rhetorical structure. The what is the what is the element. The how is the method, right? So when I'm saying the how, like I can, I can express, I can say, okay, here's what this mistake looks like in real life. And I can express that using a sentence that is like a person's internal dialogue in quotes, right?

[00:27:45]
**Bradley:**
Or I could just use literally like a regular sentence that literally just points out point blank what the mistake is, right? So the manner I choose to communicate that through, which is basically the how or the method. I reserve the free will to mix and match that however I want. I don't think that's going to be a big deal. And I think that is where AI Comes in a lot better because AI can basically pull exact like dialogue quotes and transcript text from my brain dump and say, hey, here's how you.

[00:28:29]
**Bradley:**
Here's like a couple ways that you expressed or community, how you expressed this idea or this concept. Which way do you think we should implement it, right? Do you think we should use this way where you basically went off on a rant? Or do you think we should use this other description that achieves the same effect? But anyway, that's the key thing is I think you're using the AI not always.

[00:28:56]
**Bradley:**
I mean, sometimes, but not always to like come up with brand new witty and pithy and like creative how or like methods of expressing these things. But you're rather saying, okay, my first choice, like my first string, my starters, right? The starters on my roster, on my depth chart is going to be, I would rather have you, Arno, go and hunt down a specific like, quote or line from my brain dump voice note transcript. And like, see, if I express this idea in a couple different ways, give me those options and then let's find one that fits the mold when that, like, hits hard and resonates and makes sense. And it's how I would personally say this, using my own word choice, right?

[00:29:54]
**Bradley:**
And I think so that's my first, first level. Like first string starter quarterback. Find an exact. Find at least one or maybe two or three examples of how I expressed this particular idea in the brain dump voice note transcript that would fit well into this particular rhetorical move or rhetorical or just like 1, 3, 1 writing rhythm or section or whatever, right?

[00:30:30]
**Bradley:**
And like, if, if I want Arno to give his own take and give his own, like, creative expression of it, and I think that's better, then sure, go for it. That's the second string. That is the second string option. All right. That's the backup quarterback.

[00:30:54]
**Bradley:**
I will say too, though, like, one valuable thing I think that I, that I've realized that has been stressing me out a ton recently has been whenever I sort of distance myself from the original raw source content, for example, whenever I just like, instead of actually going back and literally like manually reading with my own eyes my past brain dump voice note transcripts. Like, if instead of that, my default is always to go to, oh, well, Arno can, you know, extract ideas and insights and like, better perspectives than me very like, much quicker than I can. He can synthesize all this stuff. So let me just prompt him to basically do all the heavy lifting with the like, analyzing and extracting and hunting down key Ideas and phrases in the voice note transcript. Right.

[00:32:00]
**Bradley:**
But I think what this does is it forces Arno to be this sort of like, sort of like this masked, masked, unpredictable filter where I don't know, like I don't know if he's going to pull out things that I would personally. Right. And that's okay. Like I think the, the whole function of this is okay, I want to understand like high level overview. Here's all my brain dump, like unstructured raw content.

[00:32:34]
**Bradley:**
And I basically want you to help me like organize and clarify my, my ideas and put them into a logical order, progression and flow and understand how they relate to one another and maybe how I could present these, you know, in a certain format. Right. It's kind of like I have all these random sources or references that I'm writing a research paper for college and I have like a billion different sources and random text snippets. But I need an assistant to basically tell me, hey, examples, 1, 2, 3. Those make the most sense here.

[00:33:21]
**Bradley:**
And so you should use those and you should plug them in this order. Right.

[00:33:32]
**Bradley:**
And then you can actually go deeper. I think that's what you use it as is basically like a, I'm trying to think. It's kind of like a Tiago forte concept where it's like you have an archipelago, archipelago, archipelago, archipelago, something like that. Basically like all these little mountain, top peak islands. And you can then dive deeper into like a particular point where if Arno brings up a main point as just kind of like a brief principle or summary and I'm like, you know what, I really like that I want to get more, I want to get closer to it.

[00:34:14]
**Bradley:**
I want to see if I said anything like that just hits hard or if I said anything unique. If I used any unique word choice or shared something that you know is worth snagging from the raw content, then I would use that as a jumping off point, basically like a diving point. Where do you. Where I could then go, okay, cool. It's kind of like a table of contents, right?

[00:34:39]
**Bradley:**
Like you look and go, okay, you know, I like that chapter and that chapter. Those are the ones I'm going to look at first. And then you just jump to them. Right. So you use those almost as like scouting points.

[00:34:57]
**Bradley:**
But yeah, so what I found is that has helped me to de. Stress and like feel much more kind of like, like I'm in the know or I'm down on the ground level like firsthand. I'm not, I'm not missing anything. I'm not you know, removed or like trying to. Trying to look through, you know, a glass mirror or look through some sort of tinted shades.

[00:35:34]
**Bradley:**
What helps me to feel like I'm actually getting to like, real full clarity picture is when I go and study the actual original brain dump voice note transcript, right? And I would say, like, I wouldn't recommend this in all cases. Like, like, for example, for Laney's newsletter, I'm not, I'm just not going to go, like, study the whole thing. I might go peek at it for a couple things to, like, try to double check if Arno is matching word choice or something, or like matching actual stories that are real. But from my own personal perspective, I don't want Arno to be like the unknowing gatekeeper of my best ping phrases.

[00:36:27]
**Bradley:**
Like ping phrases and unique perspectives and like named and claimed concepts or frameworks. Right?

[00:36:38]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, I think that's going to be my approach for this is like, if I have a massive brain dump transcript on here. Here are three different parts to three different brain dump transcripts combined and stitched together on the topic of creating custom instructions for your AI to turn it into a collaborative partner. And I'm like, dude, I don't have time to sift through that entire thing. What I'd do is I'd be like, hey, Arnold, go piece by piece. I want you to identify the goal and purpose.

[00:37:10]
**Bradley:**
And also the, like, the goal and purpose is essentially the headline, right? The target or the North Star, the desired outcome or the promise. And then I want you to identify main points and sub points for each section, right? And then I just use that as a table of contents. Or then I can pick individual, I guess, chapters.

[00:37:36]
**Bradley:**
Or you treat the points and sub points as chapters and you're like, okay, this one I really want to get a concrete example of in my own word choice. Or I remember expressing this in a, like, in a really clear and valuable way. Or maybe you don't even know, you don't even remember whether what you said on that specific point was good or not. But if something catches your eye or your gut feeling, you then dive into that point like it is a chapter and go to the raw brain dump voice note transcript. And what I would do is I would just go, okay.

[00:38:22]
**Bradley:**
I'd be like, okay, cool. I'm going to, like, what I'm deliberately going to extract here is going to be again, like named and claimed frameworks as well as specific word choice, or like pithy and witty statements where I maybe said something that was very unfiltered or I said it in a way that just sounded just like me. My own personal voice that no one else can replicate, not even Arno. And I would go and I would highlight or capture that. I might even.

[00:39:03]
**Bradley:**
What I'd probably do is I'd probably like, copy it and save it to a. So paste, right? The P, A S T E, the paste pin board app, like the Clipboard manager. What I do is I would copy that line or that text to a specific paste pin board. And then I probably.

[00:39:25]
**Bradley:**
What I do is I would go to a notion doc and I would like just unload basically as bullet points. I just unload every single little highlight snippet that I captured from that particular Brain Dump transcript. And then I would sort of group them into different little groupings of bullets. And then I would, once I'm confident that it's basically like affinitizing them, right? Affinity, find which ones have affinity for each other, which one group.

[00:39:58]
**Bradley:**
Well, and then I slap a subhead or header on top of those bullet points just to give that group some sort of, like, label or category, right?

[00:40:12]
**Bradley:**
And the category should sort of indicate the topic or like the point that each of those highlights is. You know, each of those highlights represents or contributes to. And then also the implementation, right? Like, and maybe you might use this as an inline thing, but you might write a little like hashtag note next to one of the bullet points and say, use this as a conversational dialogue quote in this section of the Day one email, right? And that kind of thing.

[00:40:55]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, I've talked about this before, though. Like, this actually makes a lot of sense. So before I would even deep dive into highlighting and snipping specific, like, text snippets from the. The Brain Dump transcript, what I do is I would go and I'd be like, okay, cool. Because remember, there's three.

[00:41:28]
**Bradley:**
There's three components or three aspects of content, right? You have number one, structure, number two, the content itself, right? Like the ideas and the concepts. And then number three, you have the style, right? The way it's presented.

[00:41:47]
**Bradley:**
So structure, content and style, the three components or elements of content. So to follow that sort of mental model, what I'd do is I'd go, okay, so for day one through five. So day one, email to day five email. Let's lay down this railroad track. Let's lay down the scaffolding.

[00:42:12]
**Bradley:**
Let's lay down the skeleton. Let's lay down the. The foundation of this house, right? What does that look like? Okay, what are the main.

[00:42:23]
**Bradley:**
What Are the main sections like the main points? Right. We're talking about the. We have the headline which is the subject line plus the subtext, right? We already know that it's going to be the same for every day.

[00:42:36]
**Bradley:**
It's just going to be that day's particular mistake plus a negative outcome or a positive outcome. Right? Cool. That's predictable. Now let's make the other main sections predictable, right?

[00:42:50]
**Bradley:**
So we're always going to have, always going to have an intro. And honestly like even the content of that intro is pretty scripted based on the biggest mistakes EEC template or like category. So don't really need to worry about the intro too much. But then we're gonna go, okay, the, like, the first main subhead, which is an H2 header is the mistake. And then you.

[00:43:20]
**Bradley:**
It's like the mistake colon and then you insert the mistake. Right, Cool. That makes sense.

[00:43:28]
**Bradley:**
And I think we're going to follow just basically the same format or template and flow of like the actual content within that mistake subhead section as the original biggest mistakes EEC template. That's fine. And then we're going to go to the next section, which is the reason why this happens, right? I think this sort of parallels really well, just to let you know, with. So going back to the five components of a perfect course module, right?

[00:44:03]
**Bradley:**
Which is a different framework.

[00:44:08]
**Bradley:**
The first component is reasons why, AKA benefits. Really the like. If we're comparing that to this other section, which is the reason why this mistake happens, right? That's basically just like the inverse, right? You're basically just debugging someone's old POV or you know, the old thinking, emotions and myths, mistakes, misconceptions that they used to have so that you can help them move forward.

[00:44:45]
**Bradley:**
Right? So instead of reasons why benefits, you have reasons why, which is what? Like I want to say costs. I don't know if it's directly comparable, but.

[00:45:00]
**Bradley:**
But oh no, here's what it is. It's the reasons why this happens. And it. You expand that with the negative outcomes, right? Which is basically the opposite of the benefits, right?

[00:45:13]
**Bradley:**
Benefit, cost, benefit, negative outcome. Benefit is a positive outcome, so it pairs with a negative outcome. Cool. Those are just two sides of the same coin, polar ends of the spectrum, inverses or opposites of each other. So.

[00:45:33]
**Bradley:**
Right. So we have reasons why this happens. Negative outcomes or costs. Right.

[00:45:43]
**Bradley:**
And that follows, that comes after the mistakes to avoid which are the problems. Right? Cool. And then the end how to fix it section, it's just action steps, right? Which looking at this.

[00:45:58]
**Bradley:**
So then we're looking at the five components of the perfect course module. It has, it says step three. There is steps, how to basically action steps. Right. And that again that whole like section or component or proven approach element is found in the other framework called the six fundamental building blocks framework.

[00:46:23]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:46:25]
**Bradley:**
It's that six fundamental building blocks of every book, course or digital product that I create. And so anyway, all I'm saying is that these things overlap a lot. It's just that the like the subtle pairings or groupings and the order and progression is a little bit different. Right, Cool. And then here's the only difference from mine.

[00:46:54]
**Bradley:**
Right. So instead of just ending on. Okay, and here's how to fix it. Here's three basic action steps. Hope you have a nice day.

[00:47:01]
**Bradley:**
See you later. No, mine goes beyond that and it starts to more so like parallel and match up with the six fundamental building blocks framework. Because now after we've cleared up those, after we've cleared up like the thinking, the old thinking, the old like the emotion, the thinking, reframed the emotion, reframe the myths and mistake. Reframe. Now we're not just ending on action steps which is item number four out of six in that framework or step number four.

[00:47:43]
**Bradley:**
I guess now we're going to follow that up with item number five which is examples. Right. And I'm going to use the bad example versus good example framework here and I've already talked about how I'm going to do that through like at least for this day one email. Screenshots of a generic customer service AI responses versus a collaborative partner AI's responses to the same product. Right.

[00:48:24]
**Bradley:**
Good juxtaposition. So cool. And I think the, so like the example wouldn't. Here's the history of the tough thing is that these last three items are sort of grouped together just like the first three. So just like the thinking, emotions and myths slash mistakes, those are all paired together.

[00:48:55]
**Bradley:**
That's like half of the six fundamental building box framework. That's the front half. The back half is the action steps plus examples plus templates. Right. Which is like the fill in the blank template.

[00:49:15]
**Bradley:**
So what this, like what this perfect course module framework is suggesting is that you do a walk through example which is proof of what you're teaching and how it works. Basically getting the reader to take action and experience it for themselves. Right, let's see. So yeah, so we go, we'd go, okay, here's the action steps. Maybe like a quick 1, 2, 3 high level overview like bullet points.

[00:49:51]
**Bradley:**
Just like the big. Just like the biggest mistakes EEC already has set up, right? Okay, three bullet points, three main high level overview action steps, right? Maybe with a little detailed explanation. But then once we get to the the actual example section, this is where were going beyond just the regular biggest mistakes EEC template.

[00:50:21]
**Bradley:**
Right? This is why I was having such a hard time trying to force myself to write this and why I was getting so like, so like drawn in and up close, frozen and transfixed and glued to trying to figure out coals 131. Writing rhythm with rhetorical structure, templates and all that jazz was because I didn't have like a clear and simple and like just like logical outline, right? Because I knew I wanted to implement action steps with examples and a template. But I was like, there's just a disconnect in my mind between where does that actually go?

[00:51:13]
**Bradley:**
So now that I understand that, I start high level with the outline. Okay. Now I have action steps that then bridges to examples and that bridges to template, right? And then template from there bridges to the next email reminder. Right?

[00:51:31]
**Bradley:**
Tomorrow's email and then that bridges to the sign off. Right? And really I think the CTA is sort of implied or like embedded in the template, but then maybe there's like a reminder of it somewhere at the end. I don't know.

[00:51:53]
**Bradley:**
Cool.

[00:51:59]
**Bradley:**
So let's see. Yes, you have a walk through. I'm trying to think of this. Probably the best model to emulate, dude would just be literally the right. With AI Wwai newsletters by Cole and Dickie.

[00:52:15]
**Bradley:**
Because those are literally like. That's exactly what I'm trying to do here on the back half. And honestly, most of those news newsletters are a good representation of the overall like flow and main sections and like logic and components that I would be using to write each individual day's email. Anyway, right. Because they always start with the thinking too.

[00:52:41]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, yeah, I would just, I would look at that to kind of see how. Because it's not going to just be. Okay, here's the action steps. Cool, hard line break. Next up we have the examples.

[00:52:56]
**Bradley:**
Cool, hard line break. Now we have the template. Cool, hard line break. It's more so like these things bounce back and forth off of each other. Like they sort of go back and forth.

[00:53:08]
**Bradley:**
So you might have. Okay, here's a high level overview of the action steps, bullet points. One, two, three. And then you have. Okay, cool.

[00:53:17]
**Bradley:**
Now I'm walking you through these one by one in detail. Like down to earth, boots on the ground firsthand. Let's do this in the trenches, over the shoulder version, right? So you go, okay, cool, here's step one. And that could be like a, an H3 subhead, so a smaller subhead, step one, just like the WWAI, right, with AI, these letters, right?

[00:53:42]
**Bradley:**
So step one, do this, right? Little explanation, description of what you need to inputs you need to gather things you need to do. Okay, and now here's a, a picture, right? A screenshot of what that looks like when I have typed this prompt into the like the chat text field. Screenshot of that.

[00:54:10]
**Bradley:**
And then right below that is, here's a screenshot of the output, right? The response, what that looks like, right? And if you want to add annotations, like if you absolutely have to, great, do it. I would keep that super simple and like basic and clean anyway.

[00:54:41]
**Bradley:**
But yeah man, that's how it goes. So just look at the right with AI at the WWI and these letters to kind of see how we're trade on off between like. Okay, here is action step number one. Okay, cool. Here is example of action step number one.

[00:54:59]
**Bradley:**
Screenshot. Screenshot. Maybe a little bit of commentary or annotation or guidance, whatever. Maybe add in a pro tip, right? You can always add in like little, little additional smaller elements, like smaller proven approach elements.

[00:55:16]
**Bradley:**
Such as here's a pro tip, right?

[00:55:21]
**Bradley:**
Or I don't know, here's the quote. I don't know, Whatever, whatever. Whatever. Here's whatever. So you have an example and then you have the template, right, which is the, the code block format, basically like the markdown formatted code block that's like placed in the email and rendered in the email and that contains the actual prompt template, right?

[00:55:51]
**Bradley:**
Which is again the template. So you go copy and paste this. Cool. You've already seen an example of, you've already been given the action step of what to do. You've been given a walkthrough example of what this looks like in real life and the specific inputs or things that you need to provide or customize or do, whatever.

[00:56:11]
**Bradley:**
So you're basically like eliminating any uncertainty or any ambiguity. Ambiguity, right. You're just basically eliminating any objections or concerns by being super clear and basically using pre resolvers or concern killers to like overcome any potential like potential derailment points, right? And this is present in the like the perfect course module framework. The like step number four is commonly asked questions, AKA objections.

[00:56:52]
**Bradley:**
So this is like how I will implement that component into my specific context, right? So I think, let's see. Yes, it looks like they kind of sandwich the, the FAQ like the commonly asked questions, AKA objections, they sandwich that right between the action steps and the walk through example.

[00:57:26]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, anyway man, somewhere you might just be giving pro tips or clarifying notes or basically telling people, hey, I know you might think this matters, but it doesn't. Just do this either choose A or choose B, move on. Right? Any sort of a potential friction point where they might be overthinking it or friction point where they might be tempted to go, this is a little bit too hard right now. This requires too much brain power or I don't have all the convenient like inputs or resources I need so I'm just going to leave this alone.

[00:58:04]
**Bradley:**
Right. So yeah, anyway, an example of that would be like oh well if I'm creating my custom instructions like my personal AI's identity, I haven't thought of the perfect name for it yet. And what I could say to pre resolve that would be something like, I don't know, pick like literally just pick the name of the first best friend, the first friend that comes to mind. Like literally just gut feeling in the next five seconds. What is the first friends name that comes to mind?

[00:58:55]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool, put that in there as a placeholder. You can always come back and change it later. But I'm not going to let your indecision or like uncertainty stop you from moving forward and filling out this template and completing the action step through to the goal line. Right? So you basically just make, you kind of make assumptions for people.

[00:59:19]
**Bradley:**
Kind of like when I was selling door to door pest control in Wichita, Kansas and the husband was like I think I need to talk to my wife. Then I have to step in and assume the role for her and basically say what she's going to. What I predict she's gonna say. I'd be like oh yeah, she'll love it. Like obviously she's not gonna have anything against getting rid of the spiders, right?

[00:59:45]
**Bradley:**
So this is another scenario where if there's any sort of uncertainty or ambiguity or like unknowns, right, like unknown variables or I guess inconveniences, like somebody doesn't have the information or the resource or the materials or whatever they need to be able to execute the action step in the moment, you have to provide them with a, like a placeholder option or you have to somehow like pre resolve that basically negate it and just say okay, here's how we'll like just set it up for now or here's maybe something that you can skip whatever come back to but you just assume you make the decision for them and Then you tell them how to proceed from there and how they can always, like, it's no risk. You can always come back and like change this. But let's get something down on paper in place in this fill in the blank template. Now you can always come back and tweak it later. No worries.

[01:00:55]
**Bradley:**
Or just giving people a clear choice. Like, would you prefer option. Prefer option A or B? Cool. Pick one.

[01:01:02]
**Bradley:**
Whichever one works for you. Free version of ChatGPT or Pay. Like, you're gonna get better response from pay, but this template, like, it's gonna work either way you go. That's not an excuse.

[01:01:20]
**Bradley:**
You can always upgrade later. But get this template done now and enjoy the benefits. It's only gonna get better from here if you decide to get paid.

[01:01:33]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[01:01:44]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Yeah, man, I think I'm. I'm pretty. Sorry. I'm pretty gassed out.

[01:01:48]
**Bradley:**
I'm pretty tapped out in terms of.

[01:01:56]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, anyway, I'm pretty gassed out and tapped out in terms of outlining this thing. I feel like I've done a pretty comprehensive job.

[01:02:04]
**Bradley:**
Right. I will say one thing to be very cautious of and like cognizant of and like, observant and on guard. Just be wary of this. You're going to be tempted to either either add in like additional action steps or sub, like sub steps for each action or like to add nuance and clarity for different scenarios or situations or whatever. Because in your mind, it's going to be.

[01:02:43]
**Bradley:**
In your mind, you're going to be like, oh, man, it's unacceptable that I don't at least point this how. Right. Otherwise they'll discover that what I said here was incorrect because it doesn't apply all the time. But that doesn't matter. You're also going to be tempted to use your most advanced prompt templates that get the highest accuracy results that are, quite frankly, impressive.

[01:03:07]
**Bradley:**
But at the end of the day, like, you cannot, you cannot do that because, number one, it's gonna prevent you from getting this thing done, like, at all in the next month. Like, it's gonna take you an extra month or two. That's gonna rob you of like, real life relationships and connections that you need to make both in PGA and with family members and with like Utah, Utah guys and gals. Whoever else. Work partners.

[01:03:42]
**Bradley:**
You said you want a work partner. Like dad has Steve Scow. Like, I had Jeremy Levitt for a while. Just like, what was I going to say?

[01:03:55]
**Bradley:**
Who else? I don't know. There's another example. Just like I had Matt Pickett. Just like I had Nicholas Roop, right?

[01:04:05]
**Bradley:**
Like, I've been wanting an actual collaborative work partner, like real life work partner, and I need to step up my game and actually like publish my own work and get this, like, first draft version done, this first iteration done. This is just version one. Get it out there, okay? And I'd say the second thing is if you allow yourself to fall into the temptation and the trap of giving a. Giving a more like a higher, more advanced level prompts template, or more like overly nuanced and like beefed up action steps or examples or annotations or whatever, I guarantee you the reader will pull away.

[01:05:05]
**Bradley:**
They will not understand as well. Even though you think you're explaining better, they will actually understand less because they are already like maxed out and on the brink of being overwhelmed by just applying the surface level step that you taught them, right? The most basic step that seems so easy and obvious and intuitive and instinctive to you and basically seems like baby stuff. And you feel like, man, I'm not giving these people what they deserve. I'm not giving them enough.

[01:05:42]
**Bradley:**
That person just like Lara, just like mom, just like John Michelson, just like anybody else, honestly, feels like tapped out or maxed out at the. At like the perfect point of the intersection between skill and challenge. Just applying that one basic baby step right now, and they need time to sit with it. Like, they need time to put that into place and actually like start experiencing it and using it and like getting their feet wet, interacting with their AI with that basic step in place every day to actually, like, really truly understand what, what this even does. All right, so again, if you need, you need to triage to three levels of difficulty, like beginner, intermediate, advanced, and maybe you need Arno's help on deciding what content or what skill or whatever belongs in each category.

[01:06:58]
**Bradley:**
Great, fantastic. Ask away.

[01:07:03]
**Bradley:**
But don't overload it. Like, just think whatever is in level two is what you are going to basically like nurture people towards in terms of taking you up on like personal AI consulting or AI coaching, one on one, right? You gotta leave room for the next level for them to graduate to and they gotta prove that they can handle level one first.

[01:07:40]
**Bradley:**
Okay? And very last thing I will say is just once you have clearly, like, outlined the outline and you've expanded your, your like, final EEC outline, right? From the five mistakes, you expand those with like action steps, examples, templates, whatever, just as bullet points only once you've done that and you're confident on actual, like the main sections and order and flow then you will actually like look for these specific sentence by sentence patterns, or like rhetorical directives, rhetorical moves, rhetorical structure, prompt template stuff, and you'll find the brain dump voice note transcript, like actual content like I was describing before, hunting that down with a first string versus second string mentality. And that's where you'll source the content from, and then plug it into that sort of directive or structure where it's more in line. Once you've established the main points and sub points.

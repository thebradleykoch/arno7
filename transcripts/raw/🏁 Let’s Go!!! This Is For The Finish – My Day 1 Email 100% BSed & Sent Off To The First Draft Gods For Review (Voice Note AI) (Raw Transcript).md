# üèÅ Let‚Äôs Go!!! This Is For The Finish ‚Äì My Day 1 Email 100% BSed & Sent Off To The First Draft Gods For Review (Voice Note AI) (Raw Transcript)

[00:00:08]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. So let's see.

[00:00:13]
**Bradley:**
I. Right now, here's what I'm thinking in this voice note. Like I don't, I don't want to have to really dissect this one too deeply. I just want to straight up lay down the, like, lay down the actual actionable steps or like real life usable scripts and content as they should be. Like in final format, in the format I'm actually going to use them in without having to do a lot of, a lot of extraction or jumping through the hoops.

[00:00:59]
**Bradley:**
So here it is, clear cut, simple and straightforward.

[00:01:10]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, here's the thing. I think so Nicholas Cole's one three one writing rhythm. And honestly, like all of his other writing rhythms, right? Like his one. I think it's his 12531 or something like that.

[00:01:30]
**Bradley:**
And then he has like a 11141. I don't know, there's, there's like a billion different writing rhythm, writing rhythm blocks or formats you could follow. Basically what I'm. What I'm taking away just from his content that I'm reading online. Like all of the, you know, all of the different wwai write with AI newsletters and his individual posts in the school S K O O L school community.

[00:02:08]
**Bradley:**
Like I can't, I can't easily and predictably pinpoint a specific writing rhythm that he's following deterministically. Right. I think it's much more so like, hey, here are these different writing rhythms and you can use them as basically like a structure or a template to follow to get you started. But at the end of the day, like this is not a hard and fast rule. You don't have to like stick to these 100% verbatim because sometimes writing is messy and sometimes you add your own style and flavor.

[00:02:48]
**Bradley:**
So just use those as a basically, basically a launching pad or starting point to get from 0 to 80%. And then the last 20% is, you know, you can freestyle it, make your own personal adjustments however you feel. Right.

[00:03:10]
**Bradley:**
That is an upgraded new POV that I didn't have before. My old POV was I believed that Cole very like religiously stuck to any one of his given writing rhythms. And he like followed those exactly without really straying from them. But I just don't think that's how it is. Right?

[00:03:39]
**Bradley:**
We got the, the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. You kind of gotta use both. So anyway, moving on from that realization, I think even so in each day's email for this 5 mistakes EEC for this educational Email course. I don't think that I'm going to exactly follow Cole's 1,3:1 writing rhythm. I might stray from it a bit.

[00:04:12]
**Bradley:**
I think the main thing that I want to do to just keep this tight and focused without like bleeding my attention off into all these different tangents is I'm gonna rewatch the module 3 writing video where Cole walks you through, walks you through his example of writing Day one's email. And I'm just gonna follow along as much as possible and implement, just directly implement his 131 writing rhythm right there on my screen. I'm just gonna have a side by side side screen. On the left side is going to be Cole's video playing and I'm going to pause it and play it. And then on the right side is going to be my notion doc that I have open where I'm writing this out.

[00:05:02]
**Bradley:**
Right, let's see.

[00:05:14]
**Bradley:**
And I'm just going to, I'm just going to try to do a like, like a follow along, follow me or like follow over the shoulder approach, even though it's not going to be perfect and there's going to be some bumpy potholes. That's okay. We're going to, we're going to follow this freeway to our destination at the end of the day and I'm going to make my tweaks as needed. I think really, honestly, only the main, the main sections and places where I will probably stray from. Where I will stray from Kohl's original guidance is like the sections at the end where I appended those and I extended those, where I basically added on multiple, you know, extra subsections, either H2 headers or H3 headers.

[00:06:10]
**Bradley:**
And that totally makes sense because it's like, well, if I modified the end of the day one template, then yeah, obviously I'm going to stray from Cole's 131 writing rhythm the way that he presents it, because he only shows you how to, how to use it within the sections that he outlines. Right. So anyway, that just makes sense. So keep whatever it is that is the same, keep it the same. Just try to match and mirror, you know, my implementation to Cole's demonstration as much as possible.

[00:06:48]
**Bradley:**
But wherever I have made like deliberate changes, that's where it becomes really obvious. Like, okay, cool, you can break free from the mold now. You should, like, use your own critical thinking a little bit more now instead of trying to like force fit or deterministically prescribe some arbitrary writing rhythm or template or rhetorical structure that was just never given by Cole in the first place, because these are your own sections that you've personally added for your own personal educational email course. Right. So anyway, flow with the mentor, but feel free to chart your own course for the checkpoints and the way points that you need to make sense.

[00:07:47]
**Bradley:**
Cool. Let's see.

[00:07:55]
**Bradley:**
And I think, honestly, man, so the. Probably the easiest way to go about this, just to, like, blitz through on, like, a skim board level and just get all the way through this. Do a first pass would be like, I. I have a bunch of different deep AI chat threads, both in Claude, by Anthropic and also in ChatGPT. And I could try to, like, make sure I'm not missing any puzzle pieces by, like, over herding, like, herding all of these, like, cattle and trying to account for every single one and every single, you know, artifact or message within each of these chat threads.

[00:08:41]
**Bradley:**
But I think that's just insanity, right? Like, these chat threads should basically serve as, like, opening loops of ideation and exploration and brainstorming and then whatever, you know, whatever, like, key artifacts or messages, like, absolutely resonate with me 100%, you know, at a, like, a 95% plus level gut feeling. Like, you just take one look and you're like, yeah, he's him. Like, that's the one. Just go with those.

[00:09:20]
**Bradley:**
And those are usually gonna be the ones that will naturally pop into your memory and come to your subconscious mind without you having to go and, like, forcefully hunt them down and go scorched earth mode and explore every square inch of the planet to try to account for, you know, potential gems that you may have left on the. On the table. Right. I think that's just a very unloving and also broken and, I guess, frenzied way of going about it. That is how the old Bradley would approach it, because he's terrified of the uncertainty of potentially missing a puzzle piece or missing a diamond in the mine.

[00:10:12]
**Bradley:**
But the new Bradley, the upgraded Bradley, is confident that what's essential, like the essential diamonds and gems, will come to mind and they will show themselves, they will manifest, and they will appear as he puts himself out there and starts putting himself in motion and taking the next steps. And he knows that they will naturally fall into place as he, you know, does his best and also trusts God to, like, spiritually surface these things and put these stepping stones into the right places, because that's his job to do.

[00:11:06]
**Bradley:**
That's all up to his power. It's something that I can try to do all I want myself, but I Just I don't have the actual power or ability to. And I just gotta, I gotta give it up to him, put those responsibilities and those skills in his hands and take my responsibilities and skills that I'm accountable for and take them into my hands. Right.

[00:11:38]
**Bradley:**
That's how we tag team this. Tag team this in a way that feels, you know, smooth and flows with momentum instead of feeling like I'm ripping my hair out, running circles in my own mind alone.

[00:12:00]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, man, I think, I think the way that I'm gonna do this is going to be so I need some sort of like one funnel or one main like inflow or intake place where I'm going to capture these, you know, these key, I don't know what you want to call them. These key ideas or things that I definitely want to apply that come into my mind. Right. So I'm just trying to think, I think, I mean, ideally we have a capture system. The purpose of that capture system is to eventually put these elements on the page in like, in their real life format, in real life content.

[00:12:52]
**Bradley:**
Because that is the final destination. Right. Ultimately, if we can skip, if we can skip the middleman and just go from point A to point Z, we'll do that. Right. So if, if I notice something in a markdown file artifact from one of my Claude AI chats, for example, that I'm like, oh yeah, I definitely want to make sure that I include this key element within my, you know, in my element labels or in my element names when I'm outlining this in notion, then I would literally just pull up that artifact on one side of my screen and then pull up my notion page on the other and like just go back and forth, like copy and implement any of the, you know, key things that I need to just transfer them over.

[00:13:52]
**Bradley:**
Cool. Put them in their final format. Hopefully there's not a lot of like extra steps. This should just be really like just be like picking strawberries and putting them in a basket. Right?

[00:14:02]
**Bradley:**
We're not trying to pick strawberries and then make them into jam and then transport them across the world. Right. We're literally just picking berries, putting them in the basket. It should be a very like one to one easy transfer. And then once I've done that, once I know that these key changes are put into place in their final destination, then I can breathe a sigh of relief.

[00:14:30]
**Bradley:**
I can feel peace of mind because I know that this like, this inspiration source, which is the markdown artifact from the AI chat, I know that that is accounted for and I Can basically check it off my list and I can close it and I don't need to open it back up again or come back to it ever again if I, if I don't want to. But at least I don't need to reopen it for like the foreseeable future until I'm done writing, writing this five day educational email course, right? It's basically like, okay, loop closed, cool. Seal the grave. Checking off the list, close that book.

[00:15:13]
**Bradley:**
I'm not gonna leave it, you know, open or visible for me to accidentally like see it again as a shiny object and then go restudy it and open up new loops, right? So anyway, yeah, I think that's super important is like, let's close these loops. And the only loops that loops that we're closing are the like the essential diamonds that naturally and spiritually pop into my mind on a subconscious level as I'm going through this, right. I'm not trying to check the box for every single, you know, micro diamond in the mine. I'm literally just letting the essentials flow into my lane and picking them up like, like I'm driving Mario Kart and I'm, and I'm running into those power up cubes and I'm just absorbing them, right?

[00:16:18]
**Bradley:**
I just hit the ones that are in my lane and then we keep going forwards.

[00:16:27]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, I think, I think that's going to be a good approach. That's going to be a good mental shift that'll make things a lot more peaceful and calm and confident for me going forward. Calm the stormy.

[00:16:50]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. And then I'd say this next part is one of like one of the most important breakthroughs that I've made mentally. And I need to just apply it now like full send, launch the rocket to the moon. Make it happen. And that is that when I am like as I've been creating this outline, but it's basically a, an email structure outline plus.

[00:17:21]
**Bradley:**
Well, no, here's what I called it. I think I called it the email component structure plus element outline, right? It's just the structure and the elements, right? So it's beyond the initial prep, the page skeleton outline, but it's still, you know, still coming before the actual like full on email content for the first draft, right. And so in this sort of middle intermediate stage, what I'm doing is I am, I'm outlining the elements, but then I am specifically upgrading these element bullet points in a way that uses descriptive prompts.

[00:18:14]
**Bradley:**
And I'm basically turning, you know, I'm turning these rhetorical moves or these rhetorical directives which are basically just, you know, the element bullet points or the element element and content descriptions of what to include in each section. I'm turning those into self prompt interview questions. And one thing I'd say is like you can literally just go and just write, write the outline, right? Write the bullet points. But just make sure that the way that you write the bullet points using these descriptive statements, uses descriptive statements that are worded or phrased in a way that makes them very easy to immediately flip over into a question format of that same descriptive statement.

[00:19:19]
**Bradley:**
Right? So for example, so let's see, let's see. So this is in the section, in the sub head section called the reason this happens.

[00:20:21]
**Bradley:**
Let's see.

[00:20:24]
**Bradley:**
So here's one of the bullet points for that section. I said here's the descriptive statement. Basically it says hit them with a throwback snapshot, AKA mini history lesson, bringing awareness to the old POV and where it came from, using relatable examples. Right? So that's the descriptive statement that's very easy to like flip over into a question formatted version of that statement with a very like minor tweaks.

[00:21:09]
**Bradley:**
So the way that I turn that into a self prompt interview question would be something like where, like looking back in time, where exactly did this like mistake originate and where did it come from and what were the specific relatable examples of real life situations that formed this old POV in people's minds? Right, Something like that. I'm kind of, I'm riffing here, it's a little bit messy, but just basically turning that into a question. Right? And that way it's really easy for me to think instead of trying to like and trying to, instead of trying to write on top of the statement or trying to write over the statement and think, okay, well how do I write this?

[00:22:23]
**Bradley:**
Instead you turn it into a question which naturally prompts you to fill in the blank. So it's like, oh, okay, well let me tell you conversationally in a voice note. I would say that like looking back in time in history, probably a good relatable example is when Siri first came out for Apple back in 2011. And it was supposed to be like this revolutionary new, you know, AI innovation that was supposed to knock your socks off. But like in reality Siri could only follow like really rigid commands and you'd have to say them perfectly word for word, otherwise Siri would misinterpret you and it, she just wouldn't work.

[00:23:21]
**Bradley:**
Right. Like, and, and the problem is like still to this day, literally like almost a decade and a half later, Syria is still just as bad. And so this is why people have been like jaded into. Not just jaded into like being over promised in terms of what their AI can do for them and under delivered on, but also like unconsciously trained into thinking that their AI must be dumb and they have to stick to a very rigid set of commands that are very short and almost like caveman sentences and they must never stray from those because otherwise the AI will misunderstand them or, or they don't even know they think. Like the AI will probably just like not even be capable of adding more value through a more conversational.

[00:24:34]
**Bradley:**
Conversational back and forth instruction rather than a rigid command. Right? So that's a little bit of more like a longer form answer to that one bullet point. But you can see it's very easy to answer when I write that descriptive statement in a way that is very easy to flip over into a self prompt interview question without like majorly changing the wording or you know, the keywords or the actual like content of that statement.

[00:25:18]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, I would honestly. And here's the thing, dude, like, I think I have way more in terms of like ideas and content than I need. Like this written out version of my day one email is like, it's gonna have to consolidate a lot or just like be very picky and choosy and selective about the points that it uses from my self prompt interview question answers that I give, right? So I wouldn't worry about that. I wouldn't worry about like perfectly phrasing the questions or perfectly answering them in like a, an ocean level of depth and clarity.

[00:26:09]
**Bradley:**
I think like if you're able to just literally get out a paragraph of conversational like a voice note transcript text, that's perfect. Like aim to answer each one of these self prompt questions with a paragraph or two worth of voice note text. And probably like unless you really are feeling on one and you want to go on a rant, I'd probably cap it at like try to keep your responses to each of these bullet questions under two minutes, right? Definitely under five because at that point you're just like going off into the Bermuda Triangle. But yeah, so that's what I do.

[00:26:57]
**Bradley:**
I would, I would aim for one or two paragraphs of text in terms of like just record my voice and transcribe that as in as like one to two paragraphs of answer text for each, for each bullet point. That is a self prompt interview question, right? And probably max it out, aim for a maximum of like two minutes worth of conversationally answering each question and hard cap it at 5 for sure.

[00:27:37]
**Bradley:**
I have no idea how many paragraphs that would be, but it's probably easier to just guess, guess the minute mark.

[00:27:48]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, that's, that's a good, that's good, that's good constraint. It's a good game plan set of rules for me going forward.

[00:28:02]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, each time that you write a descriptive statement, AKA a rhetorical directive or a rhetorical move or a like a bullet point that. A bullet point that is a rhetorical statement, just always like at the end of that double check and go back and read it again and ask yourself, okay, did I write this in a way that is like super clear and easy to read in a way that is like effortless to flip over into a self prompt interview question?

[00:28:44]
**Bradley:**
And if so like maybe just go ahead and like add another bullet point right below that and test it out. Like try rephrasing that descriptive statement as a self prompt question and see if it works. Because if it's so easy and effortless, you should be able to do that in like 10 seconds. And if it's not easy and frictionless, then that's a good sign that you got to clarify what you're, what you're aiming for with that descriptive statement. Cool.

[00:29:22]
**Bradley:**
So that's, that is the like prevailing pattern that I'm going to follow for the remainder of, you know, outlining this like structural or like whatever you want to call it, component structure plus element outline. That's. This is the pattern and approach I'm going to take. Cool. So moving on to.

[00:29:48]
**Bradley:**
I mean this is kind of moving on. So the, my personal additional like sections that I'm gonna add on to the end of this email.

[00:30:03]
**Bradley:**
Honestly I would just literally just like emulate as close as possible a good wwi. Like write with AI newsletter example, right? Like I would just look at one of those newsletters and I'd be like, okay, cool. This shows me exactly how to like sort of write and format, you know, the sections that I'm going to be using to show that I'm going to be using to like teach the new pov, right? Which is like the new mindset, the mental shift.

[00:30:43]
**Bradley:**
And then which that you, you know that subhead is going to be followed by the action steps subhead, right? Where you're just walking through the steps in detail one at a time, making it really easy to follow.

[00:31:07]
**Bradley:**
And then you're going to follow that with the.

[00:31:12]
**Bradley:**
If you're going to follow the action steps section with the examples subhead section, right? And you're going to follow. Ideally you would show a, like a black and white example or a, like a bad example versus a good example to show contrast, right? Almost like a before and after comparison. So ideally you're not just showing like, oh, here's my work.

[00:31:40]
**Bradley:**
I did it right. I aced the test. Here's how to like follow my. Copy my work, follow my writing on this math test that I turned in and just copy my work like you did in high school. But rather it should be more like, okay, look here, here's a.

[00:31:58]
**Bradley:**
Here's basically like a pro tip or like a common authority obstacle or maybe like even like sub mistake or misconception to avoid some sort of friction point that people might have at this, like during this specific action step when they try to implement the example. You'd be like, okay, now I know what you're probably thinking, and here's, here's how I know that. But we want to avoid going down that road because this is what it results in. And then like insert a screenshot of the bad example, right? That this, you know, that this sub mistake or misconception or friction point could potentially lead to.

[00:32:53]
**Bradley:**
And then contrast that. Just juxtapose that with saying, okay, cool. So here's, here are, you know, here are the obvious mistakes. Here are the less obvious mistakes. Here's an example of what that looks like.

[00:33:07]
**Bradley:**
Obviously you want to avoid that, right? Here's evidence. Cool screenshot. Now here's how we avoid that. Instead, aim for this polar end of the spectrum, right?

[00:33:22]
**Bradley:**
Aim for this and like give them context, give them specific examples or pro tips. And then right there, plop in the good example screenshot, right? It's kind of like a. Here are the red flags to avoid and the green flags to aim for, right? Just back to back, really simple and kind of walking you through how to do that and just sort of like pre resolving, pre resolving objections and pre resolving potential concerns.

[00:34:00]
**Bradley:**
It's not even like potential concerns. It's basically like pre resolving potential questions or uncertainties or, you know, like roadblocks and sort of hidden potholes that my target reader has a good chance of like getting derailed by, right? And I might have to go back in my mind and actually like reflect on these things a little bit, a little bit more deeply and zoom out and ask myself, okay, when I was at this same stage as my reader, like, what things did I try that ended up being a waste of time or not working. And like, how have I changed my approach since then? Like, what have I done differently?

[00:34:51]
**Bradley:**
How can I basically give them like a quick win and a, like give him a college degree's worth of like time saving and headache savings advice in one section. In one little section, right? Like give you a little power up, a little time saver, energy saver, skill maker level up, whatever.

[00:35:26]
**Bradley:**
And I think a key thing too here is like, I would, here's the constraint I would use. I would not try to, like, I'm not trying to account for and include an exhaustive list of all the potential obstacles or things that could go wrong and all the examples of what that looks like and all of the, you know, good examples or potential, you know, positive ways that you could go about this, followed by all these, you know, various screenshots. Like, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to present to you every single, you know, potential path you could go down. Like at the end of the day you're gonna have to go down some dead end roads yourself to really figure this out and gain pattern recognition for yourself. But I'm at least going to, like, I'm going to stop you right, right before you accidentally make that turn and I'm going to show you like the most, the most common or most, you know, prevalent and useful and helpful example of what to avoid and then also the example of what to aim for, right?

[00:36:53]
**Bradley:**
Like, I'm just going to give you basically a free, like a free get out of jail card. Right, get out of jail free card. I'm not giving you an unlimited supply because that would be me trying to account for all of the potential edge cases that I'm aware of and that I have learned through my own firsthand experience and pattern recognition. I'm not trying to give you a whole deck of get out of jail free cards by preventing every potential pitfall and giving you every potential, you know, reward or solution. I'm literally just, I'm giving you one get out of jail free card which is showing you, you know, the, the friction point or the potential obstacle to avoid.

[00:37:43]
**Bradley:**
And then also like a, I don't know what you want to call this. What's the opposite of a get out of jail free card? I'm gonna give you some free scholarship money. I'm gonna give you a little mini scholarship fund to like give you some momentum and give you a boost so you can get started and get going, get off on the right foot and have a clear path forward. But you gotta figure the rest Out.

[00:38:15]
**Bradley:**
I'm just gonna get you started. Cool. Yeah, I think that's a solid way of looking.

[00:38:25]
**Bradley:**
So let's see. How do we do this?

[00:38:32]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, it's almost like. So it's like I'm not trying to turn myself into a trust fund daddy that's gonna pad your entire college education bills. Like, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna fund the whole thing, but rather I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you like a little $5,000. 5,000. $5,000 grant or $5,000 fund to put towards your tuition.

[00:38:58]
**Bradley:**
Right. And that I'm doing that knowing that so many other people are also going to offer you their own scholarship funds. Some of them are going to be $2,000 here, some of them are going to be $20,000. Some of them might be a whole semester of 50 grand worth of tuition. In terms of like the, the level of advice that they share through their own, like, unique personal experiences and perspective and personality.

[00:39:33]
**Bradley:**
Like, that is great.

[00:39:36]
**Bradley:**
Multiple creators and different mentors and influences and people are going to contribute to your growth and evolution and education in learning this particular, you know, skill with AI. And that's great. I acknowledge that I'm not the only contributor, and I shouldn't be because that'd be failure. But rather I'm just going to give you. I'm going to give you the first stair on the staircase and I'm going to get you started, right?

[00:40:06]
**Bradley:**
I'm going to. I'm going to fill up your gas tank for the road trip and I'm going to send you off and I'm going to be calm and confident and happy and at ease within myself, knowing that I contributed that first building block without trying to force myself to overreach and make myself on the line or on the hook for providing every potential lesson or piece of advice that you'll ever need. Right? Because you'll naturally pick those up on your own from a multitude of contributors and people that you need to learn from. I'm just one star in a constellation.

[00:40:57]
**Bradley:**
Cool. So anyway, cool. So we've accounted for cool. We've got the. So basically the how to fix it section, which is how to fix the mistake.

[00:41:08]
**Bradley:**
You have the, like the new pov, the new mindset and approach. Cool. That's. That's a, like an H3 underneath the H2 how to Fix it subhead, right? So then the next H3 I talked about was the action steps, right?

[00:41:28]
**Bradley:**
The step by step walkthrough. Um, and then the next H3 is the examples, right. Bad example versus good example with some like pro tips.

[00:41:41]
**Bradley:**
Your get out of jail free card and also your first scholarship, scholarship fund card. And let's see.

[00:41:53]
**Bradley:**
And then we. And then next we have the next H3 section which is the template. Right. Cool. So the template is literally just like a.

[00:42:04]
**Bradley:**
It's a markdown formatted code block. We're just giving them a fill in the blank template that they can copy and paste in one go. And then, you know, fill in the content for the variables and the placeholders for their own, you know, their own context.

[00:42:21]
**Bradley:**
Let's see.

[00:42:25]
**Bradley:**
Cool.

[00:42:28]
**Bradley:**
Super easy. And keep in mind too, and then like, obviously, so after the template, you're going to have the next major H2 sub head section which is, you know, the next steps and the like the next email reminder. Right. Which has everything you need in it to like preview and give like a sort of a. Paint the future.

[00:42:53]
**Bradley:**
Paint a picture of the future to look forward to and prepare for of what's coming next. And then you have the sign off, whatever. Right. And so I think one thing to just prevent myself from tripping up here is that each of these H3 sub head sections that I just outlined and described, they don't necessarily follow each other like one after another in a linear order, but rather they, they almost, they almost all overlap. Right.

[00:43:23]
**Bradley:**
So I'm saying they're H3 subhead sections when really I'm just saying that because that's how I'm going to approach outlining them. Right. I'm going to put down the bullet points of the descriptive statements and content that I need to include within each of those H3E sections first. Right. But when I actually go to write that content, I might actually like sort of dissolve or rearrange or even get rid of the H3 subheads and sort of, you know, intertwine or interstitch these key component elements or component sections together in a way that flows and makes sense.

[00:44:09]
**Bradley:**
Right. So we don't have to keep everything in its own, like segregated box necessarily. We just want to make sure that each component or section or element appears where it makes most sense and where it's most easy to understand and apply and move forward on. Right, Cool. And I definitely do want to include some sort of.

[00:44:36]
**Bradley:**
So kind of like in the. I don't know if this comes right before the next step section. Maybe, maybe it is in this last H2 section that I'm calling next steps. Maybe it's like a combo of. Okay, here's a quick recap of what We've done.

[00:44:53]
**Bradley:**
Here's what you should, here's what you should have done by now. Here's the like the quick win or result that you should have. Here's where you should have like put that content where you should be at if you've been following along. Cool. We've just like shown your progress in a visually tangible way because you can look at each thing that I've shown you on this checklist and ideally you've done it and you can see your progress.

[00:45:20]
**Bradley:**
Great. Quick win. Solid dopamine hit. Keep going.

[00:45:28]
**Bradley:**
And so yeah, I don't know if that goes in like the very last H2 section or if it goes right before the last H2 section. We'll figure it out. But yeah, we need some sort of like recap that comes after the, after the template section. Right, cool. And that should be really brief but also you know, specific and tangible to like clearly demonstrate.

[00:45:57]
**Bradley:**
Here's the black and white line. Here's how you know if you've done it. Here's how you know if you haven't finished it yet and what you need to do. So cool. The last H2 section again.

[00:46:10]
**Bradley:**
Next steps and like tomorrow's email reminder. Pretty self explanatory. We got that. Cool. At this point, man, honestly, I think the only, the only potential weak spot, the only potential Achilles heel that I can foresee myself like getting derailed by.

[00:46:37]
**Bradley:**
Cuz I'm. I just want to do a PO post mortem here, right? So my potential Achilles heel that I think is most likely would be like overthinking or like just over complicating my, you know, the process of figuring out, okay, what type of media elements do we need to include such as, you know, screenshots or GIFs or like little quick video tutorial and embedded walkthroughs. Right?

[00:47:17]
**Bradley:**
And just that kind of stuff. Just the logistics of like okay, cool, what should I include and what format should it be in? You know, what's the frame rate or the screen resolution? How many of these do, how many of these do I need to include? How do I arrange it?

[00:47:35]
**Bradley:**
Like and to basically answer that question preemptively and just pre resolve that concern and uncertainty or question, I would just say like literally just always, always, always refer back to the WWI the Write with AI newsletter written by Nicholas Cole and Dickie Bush, right? The creators of ship 30 for 30. And I would literally just find like two, maybe three max newsletter examples to emulate and just like designate those as my, my north stars, right? My, my Triangle, North Star, constellation, whatever you want to call it. Like, okay, here are the two or three role model examples of the type of newsletter I'm trying to emulate.

[00:48:34]
**Bradley:**
And you should have, you know, these should have the sort of content and formatting and structure and flow that I am personally aiming for here in my five day EEC of my own. Right? Because these examples will answer your questions, right? Like once you've seen them, you'll be like, oh cool, that's how Cole and Dickie did that. I don't need to ruminate on that.

[00:49:02]
**Bradley:**
And like, think about that for 80 hours. Problem solve, right?

[00:49:11]
**Bradley:**
And that especially goes for any of the, like the multimedia elements, right? Videos, screenshots, GIFs, especially annotated screenshots. Because I think that's a place that can get really hairy and like sneak up on me in a tricky way where I can start to overthink that. Like just look at the annotated screenshots they've shown. Doesn't need to be any different or more special or unique than that.

[00:49:42]
**Bradley:**
That's it.

[00:49:45]
**Bradley:**
And when in doubt, simplify down, right? Like if you're having a hard time trying to figure out, hmm, I'm thinking I should, I should do this in a GIF format because it feels like I need to, you know, over deliver and make sure this is absolutely clear. And maybe, you know, you're, you're struggling with the gif, there's some sort of friction point. If you run into scenarios like that where you feel like you're trying to step up too much in an unnecessary way, that's not going to really make an impact or move the needle in terms of the final result or outcome. Especially from the reader's perspective, I would just go with, okay, what is the, what is the, like, like the very next most junior level, right?

[00:50:38]
**Bradley:**
Like what is the, what is the grade below me? Okay, well, if I'm looking at a gif, probably the next grade below a GIF would be a screenshot. A screenshot, maybe a screenshot with some annotations, right? And then another grade level below a screenshot with annotations would be just a plain old screenshot with no annotations, right? And you can just sort of, you can even go down the line further.

[00:51:10]
**Bradley:**
You can be like, what's a level below that? Well, a level below a plain old screenshot would literally just be like a text description that like to the best of your ability describes or shows how this should look, right? You just kind of keep going up or down the rungs on the ladder in terms of what, what sort of content best, like most clearly communicates and presents this in a way that's instantly gettable and like immediately like a no brainer in terms of how to apply it now. Right. But if you're running into sort of a glass ceiling, then just take a step back, go back from a yellow belt to a white belt, it's all good.

[00:52:15]
**Bradley:**
And then for the actual components and elements where it really matters, then step it back up to a yellow belt and you'll be able to easily like discern on a gut feeling, intuition level which of these components need to be presented in which format. Right. It should be pretty easy as far as like after you get a few reps in and yeah, I think that'd be the key thing is literally like if you're, if you're ping ponging back and forth, like just going back and forth between should I do this or that and you keep switching sides. I would just like literally just choose one. Choose one of the multiple choice options for now, like you do on a, on a test in the BYU testing center at 11:45 at night, like just before it's about to close because you gotta turn this exam in and at the end of the day clock waits for nobody.

[00:53:27]
**Bradley:**
You just gotta get a letter down on the page, just gotta get a bubble down on the Scantron and if you get it wrong, so what you come back and you learn from it later, you can always come back like during the second half of the day or tomorrow to go with a fresh set of eyes and review and reread your work to review the multiple choice option that you chose and that will instantly clarify like oh, actually this other option makes more sense. Or oh, actually that was the right option to go with. Like it flows, it makes sense. Cool, we're done here. Moving on.

[00:54:15]
**Bradley:**
Cool. Man, I have been walking out here at night. It is now 6:16pm but it's black as midnight and cold as Will Feren, the BYU field goal kicker. Cold as ice. So anyway, that's a solid stopping point for today.

[00:54:45]
**Bradley:**
Let's, let's plug this voice note transcript into assembly. AI get it transcribed, pull it up, follow it section by section and let's freaking do this. I want to, I want to be a man of substance and I want to have something of material impact to show for my efforts. At the end of the day I want to have results. I want to have a resume and actual real lived like experiences and events that go down on again that go down on my pedigree that go down on my track record and show and show you.

[00:55:40]
**Bradley:**
Hey, man, don't believe me or you want to see what that actually looks like in real life? Let me pull that up for you, and I'll show you a real life example. Because I've been there, I've done that, I've lived it.

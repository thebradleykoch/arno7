**Bradley:**
Hey, what's up, man? Good, good. My name's Bradley. You the man of the house here?

[00:00:18]
**Robert:**
Yeah, but I don't need anything, so I'll save time.

[00:00:20]
**Bradley:**
Thanks so much. Yeah, no worries. We're just stopping by because Deborah Henderson and then a bunch of the neighbors here are getting service on Friday and Saturday. So the main thing has been for a couple of the wolf spiders and then obviously the ants and the wasps too. In fact, are you guys familiar with the wolf spiders, like what they are?

[00:00:35]
**Robert:**
Okay, go ahead.

[00:00:37]
**Bradley:**
I just. Yeah, so we're just servicing a bunch of people for the spiders has been the main thing. Do you guys know what the wolf spiders are? Yeah, have you seen them?

[00:00:44]
**Robert:**
Yeah, we have them.

[00:00:45]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So everyone's been getting them out here. Problem is, as we move into September and the weather starts changing, they actually do start pushing in towards the home, so. So that's why everyone's been getting it treated right out of the gate. But the good news is since the guy's already gonna be out here tomorrow and Friday and Saturday, we're actually able to do a super cheap group rate for the whole neighborhood. So if we can get your home covered while we're here, we can do the whole thing for the same discount. Well, how much? Yeah, sure, Real quick. Do you know what the square footage is of the house?

[00:01:17]
**Robert:**
3,000.

[00:01:18]
**Robert:**
If that's not right.

[00:01:19]
**Bradley:**
3,000, like top and bottom? Yeah. Okay, cool. And as far as your basement goes, is it finished or unfinished?

[00:01:25]
**Robert:**
Half.

[00:01:26]
**Bradley:**
Okay. So only reason I ask is because in the basement the activity begins with the wolf spiders and the centipedes and they work their way up. So inside, if you ever do want that treated, we include that for free. So that way you're not getting any activity in there. And then do you guys have any kids or pets?

[00:01:42]
**Robert:**
Yeah.

[00:01:43]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So the good news is for all your neighbors out here, all the products are actually eco-friendly, so it's safe for the kids and pets. The outside's the main part though. So have you guys ever had your home treated before?

[00:01:55]
**Robert:**
Not here.

[00:01:56]
**Bradley:**
Not here. Okay, so on the outside for everyone out here, we do a premium liquid barrier 2ft up and 2ft out around the whole perimeter of the home. That way you're not getting any activity that pushes through and follows the condensation, the pipes and pops up inside because that's the pathway that they follow.

[00:02:12]
**Robert:**
We had it in Texas.

[00:02:14]
**Bradley:**
Okay, you guys had Terminix in Texas or another company?

[00:02:17]
**Robert:**
Another company.

[00:02:17]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. So then probably the different things out here that we do so for everyone else, if you see that pole right there looks kind of like a giant Q-tip. So every quarter, you know, we get the webs and the eaves and then also wasps, they like to nest up there. So all your neighbors have been getting them. So we've been treating everyone for wasps and spiders up high. So whenever we come out, we actually sweep down the eaves and we treat them for their pheromones. That way they can't keep coming back. A lot of your neighbors were getting out the broom or the pressure washer knocking them down and then they just come back a week later. So we treat them properly. That way they can't keep coming. Yeah, so for the whole thing, I'm including the granulation in the yard. So normally if you're calling us out of the phone book and we're coming out here just for you guys and that's it. Normally these size homes would be more so normally it'd be about 200 on the first treatment and then 150 each time after that. But since the guys are already gonna be out here and we're doing a group rate for the whole neighborhood, we're actually knocking it all the way down to just 99 bucks and that's it. So best part is per year of $99. So best part is it won't go back up to 200 next quarter. It'll stay the same flat rate per season and anything in between. I forgot to mention this. So we come summer, fall, winter and spring. Tomorrow would obviously be the summer treatment, but anything in between the seasons, if you see a spider pop up or anything like that, you guys are still covered because we come back out for free. Okay, so a lot of neighbors like that. Oh, I want to ask, do you guys have a deck in the backyard like a lot of the neighbors do?

[00:03:47]
**Robert:**
We do, yeah.

[00:03:47]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so a lot of your neighbors, I assume you guys get the spiders and the wasp nests trying to nest on the underside. So we actually go ahead and we do the same thing for the eaves. So we treat under there. That way you guys aren't getting anything that might bite or sting on the bottom. I know most neighbors are getting it done tomorrow in the afternoon and then Saturday in the morning. Are you guys more here in the mornings or in the afternoons?

[00:04:08]
**Robert:**
I work from home.

[00:04:09]
**Robert:**
Oh, cool.

[00:04:10]
**Bradley:**
That's the life then.

[00:04:11]
**Robert:**
Yeah, maybe couple.

[00:04:14]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, no worries. Go for. So normally if you call us out of the phone book, we do a two or three year contract, but since the guy's already going to be here, we just do a short one year. And best part is you can keep the same discount going even after the year is over. Win.

[00:05:29]
**Robert:**
All right, we'll do it.

[00:05:30]
**Robert:**
Okay.

[00:05:31]
**Bradley:**
And then so tomorrow we have a time between 3 and 5. And then on Saturday we have either 8 to 10 in the morning or 10 to 12. Which one are you guys more for tomorrow?

[00:05:39]
**Robert:**
Tomorrow and I just got a lot of room to do that. Sorry.

[00:05:44]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, so if you do want the inside treated, and then is your garage pretty accessible as well? On the inside?

[00:05:48]
**Robert:**
Yeah.

[00:05:49]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so we treat in there for the spiders as well. That way you're not getting anything crawling in your storage space. Then how do you spell your last name?

[00:05:55]
**Robert:**

[00:06:06]
**Bradley:**

[00:07:06]
**Robert:**

[00:07:11]
**Robert:**
That's fine.

[00:07:14]
**Bradley:**
And it's just a pay as you go kind of thing. So you don't need to pay the whole thing up front then. So all the premium pests are included. So that's fleas, ticks, black widow spiders, brown recluses. We'll treat you for everything when we come. And then. So did you want them to treat the garage?

[00:07:30]
**Robert:**
Yeah.

[00:07:31]
**Robert:**
Okay.

[00:07:39]
**Bradley:**
Then. So besides like the deck in the back like everyone was noticing, were you noticing any other hotspots?

[00:07:45]
**Robert:**
I mean I was seeing them in the bathroom.

[00:07:48]
**Bradley:**
In the bathroom. Okay, which one? Which bathroom?

[00:07:54]
**Robert:**
Okay.

[00:08:04]
**Bradley:**
And then so he might not arrive exactly at 3, but he'll arrive obviously between 3 and 5. Okay. Usually takes about 30 or 40 minutes to do the whole thing.

[00:08:12]
**Robert:**
Okay, awesome.

[00:08:14]
**Bradley:**
So if you just want to initial right here. This one just says we come four times. And then this one just says it's a one year thing. And today is the 16th. Then we never charge a card until two business days after the treatment's done. So we don't do cash or check, we just do debit or credit, whichever one you prefer. If you won't mind grabbing that real quick.

[00:09:22]
**Robert:**
How long have you been in sales?

[00:09:24]
**Bradley:**
About a year, so, yeah, it's been good. Just normally I'm at college during the fall and then the winter, obviously, but, yeah, during summertime is when I work out here. So do you guys have a lot of family out here or you just kind of got your own spot?

[00:10:37]
**Robert:**
Okay.

[00:10:38]
**Robert:**
So are you going to college to do something different than what you're doing?

[00:10:41]
**Bradley:**
I'm doing finance, so it's kind of related.

[00:10:44]
**Robert:**
Yeah, well, my company does. We have a lot of sales. We do computer sales.

[00:10:48]
**Bradley:**
Oh, yeah. Cool.

[00:10:51]
**Robert:**
But the way you maintain the eye contact is very hard to train people at, so you just did phenomenal. Like, out of 100 people, you're the only one that hit everything. And that's why I was like, okay, fine, I will listen.

[00:11:05]

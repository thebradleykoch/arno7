# Alec Sale â€“ Stan (RACs on RACs) (Voice Note AI) (Raw Transcript)

Alec:
I'm the strange man. You're right. That's what a lot of other people said today. I didn't know why. I love his onesie. It's awesome. So my name's Alec, other than the strange man. I'm the manager with Greenix. I'm sure you've seen our trucks out here. We do, I think, 18 of your neighbors now closest to you. Brian Altop, right next door, Pete Landry, Jeff Gerber, Dan Whittington, Jeff Bendert. We do a lot of neighbors for pest control. So it's like spiders, ants, wasps. Almost everyone I took care of today had a company. A lot of the neighbors just barely switched from like Terminix or Orkin. Do you guys have a company or not yet?
Wife:
We actually don't.
Alec:
How long have you been in the home? Oh, yeah. Gotta stay clean.
Wife:
We've been here for almost seven years now.
Kid:
Go.
Alec:
So no one has any crazy issues, obviously.
Wife:
The reason I say we did like the first year or two.
Stan:
Yeah.
Alec:
Yeah.
Wife:
They kind of came in, sprayed, and then they kind of went away.
Alec:
Yeah, it's not like...
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
I mean, because like this is us here. It's like all these stars are customers in development. Like no one here, like Brian Altop, used it for two years. Dan Cooper. It's a lot of preventative. It's good to get the home treated every one to two years. Anyways, the big thing, everyone gets the same thing as you guys. It's like cobwebs up high. Sometimes, like you get the wasps and the yellow jackets, usually in the tall peaks. So every quarter, my technician comes out. He'll use this really long brush for you. He'll sweep down all the overhangs around the home. So it keeps it really clean. We treat it as well. Everyone's like back to no.
Wife:
I know.
Alec:
He's cute. How old is he?
Wife:
He's seven. He's how old he's been here actually.
Stan:
Oh, nice.
Alec:
That's perfect. That's how you marked it.
Kid:
Yeah.
Wife:
He was like a little baby.
Alec:
Yeah.
Kid:
Cool.
Wife:
Yeah.
Alec:
So we treat it as well. So it helps keep like spiders and moths from coming back at the base. So the home's seven years old? I assume it will be coming up?
Wife:
Yeah, in a couple of weeks.
Kid:
Cool.
Alec:
So over time, everyone gets like cracks and crevices. A lot of the bugs start sneaking through there.
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
They nest in the wall voids, and then that's when you get them popping up on the interior. So every quarter, we'll use a backpack sprayer. My tech, he'll spray three feet up on the home and three feet out. That way, we keep it sealed up. So then it also flushes out bugs that are nesting in there.
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
So we do that every quarter. And then in the yard too. Cuz there's just a lot of tree coverage here. I know there's a couple of farms in the area. So there's a lot of ants that started to nest and colonize in the yard.
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
So since everything we use is eco-friendly, we'll do a granule like these little pellets.
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
We'll granulate two feet out for you guys around the home. That sinks down in like the mulch and the grass and it gets rid of all the bugs at the source.
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
So we do that every quarter. It's all guaranteed. So like if you ever see any of these in between treatments, you can call us and we'll come out for free to take care of it.
Wife:
Oh, okay.
Alec:
So it's super nice. That's why a lot of people here use us and why we have such good reviews. What we do for everyone, we treat their home for a period of 18 months. The reason being it's pretty easy to get the adult bugs. It's harder to get like eggs and pupae just cuz they like rehatch.
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
So that's why we come out quarterly. Like we'll knock down all the cobwebs as well. Price-wise, how many square feet is your home? What is what? The spider webs. Oh yeah. Oh, it's a lightning bug. Yeah, we don't take care of those.
Wife:
Those are cute, buddy.
Alec:
About 3,000. Three to 4,000.
Wife:
It's a little bit. No, we're more like 2,800.
Alec:
Cool with basement. I don't know. You're good.
Wife:
And if that's my husband, he's upstairs.
Kid:
Cool.
Alec:
And you're the one that, you're the one that kind of handles like hiring services around the home.
Wife:
I'm usually when I studio with everybody.
Alec:
You look like the boss.
Wife:
Yeah.
Alec:
Hey, happy wife. So today. Today actually marks my...
Wife:
I just tell you no and tell you to call.
Alec:
Hey. Well, I'm glad I'm talking to you then.
Wife:
Yeah.
Alec:
So today actually marks my year and a half of being married. Exactly. So. I know. Happy wife, happy life.
Wife:
I was gonna...
Alec:
What the wife wants, she gets. So quarterly we're coming out. It's just 149 bucks. I'll just price you at the 2,400, it's fine. 149 a quarter. So it's way affordable. The first service is usually $349 just because it takes more time and work.
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
Where we've done a lot of the neighbors, now our costs are a lot lower. So we're actually taking $100 off that initial. So it's just 249 bucks. And that's for everything, especially to get rid of all the cobwebs, all the wasp nests. And then if you guys ever see anything in between, like I said, we'll come out for free.
Wife:
Okay.
Alec:
Does that sound good?
Wife:
And are we... You said 18 months or something.
Alec:
18 years.
Wife:
Oh, 18 years. What?
Alec:
I was like 18 months?
Wife:
Yeah, 18 months.
Alec:
Yeah. And then most people keep us after that too. Just keep. Because they really like us. Your rate stays the same. But if you don't want after 18 months, you can stop.
Wife:
But you can't quit within the 18 months.
Alec:
Correct.
Wife:
Okay. So you're sealed in for just cuz.
Alec:
Otherwise, it just doesn't really...
Wife:
Okay, yeah.
Alec:
And we'll call you too before every quarter we service the home. What's the best phone number to get you at?
Wife:
See, this is where I would say. Okay, now you have to talk to my... I'll bring him down for you.
Alec:
Bring him out. Totally. Well, tell them I'm really nice and that you want to do it.
Wife:
They don't kill the bugs, they treat tree. So the bugs don't come. Yes. Running around outside getting dirty in the house. Baby, come on.
Alec:
Come on.
Wife:
Seriously. You're clean.
Alec:
Mother knows best.
Wife:
You don't take care of a tick, do you?
Alec:
We have a separate service for...
Wife:
I was going to say all the...
Alec:
Separate services for what we want. So sound your wife. I'm Alec. I'm here with Greenix. We do 18 of the neighbors. Right. Like Brian Altop next door. Dan Whittington, the Gerbers. So we're doing like the pest control. The reason I went topping on... Dude, I love your PJ pants too.
Kid:
Thanks.
Alec:
Nice. They look comfy.
Stan:
They are comfy.
Alec:
Way comfy. And you've got a great beard as well.
Stan:
Thank you.
Alec:
It would take me probably 10 years to get that.
Stan:
It's taken me. This is more lazy than it is.
Alec:
Love it. So what we'll do in the ease. Everyone gets the cobwebs too. Just like you guys. So we'll take a brush and sweep everything down. It keeps it clean. We treat the brush as well so you don't get like the spiders or the wasp coming back at the base. Your wife said you guys have been here for about seven years. So you get like little cracks and crevices. It's where a lot of the bugs like kind of crawl in. So every quarter we'll spray 3ft up and 3ft out around the whole foundation. That way you guys don't get stuff on the interior. And then what a lot of neighbors like too. Just because there's a lot of farm and field. Usually at this point you start getting like ants nesting around the home. So since everything we use is eco-friendly, you probably heard like Terminix before, like they're a good company, but they only treat the structure. So with us, since we're eco-friendly, we'll go out in the yard with a granule and we spread it just in a two-foot band in like the mulch and the grass right around the home. It's a bait for the bugs. So then it gets rid of like the ants, especially the carpenter ants at the source. So we do it every quarter. It's guaranteed. So like if you ever see like any of these in between treatments, you can call us and we'll come out for free to take care of it. So what we do for everyone, we treat the home for a period of 18 months. The reason being it's pretty easy to get the adult bugs, hard to get like the eggs. Price-wise. Your wife said you guys are like 2,400ish square feet. Yeah, without the basement, I'm guessing 2,800. Cool. So quarterly we come out, it's 149 bucks.
Kid:
Okay.
Alec:
So it's like way affordable. The first service is usually $349 just because it takes more time and work. We're a truck or here and we've done a lot of the neighbors. Now we're taking $100 off the initial. Okay, so it's 249 bucks. And that's for everything inside, outside. And like I said, if you guys see bugs, we'll come out for free.
Kid:
Okay.
Alec:
Sound good?
Stan:
Could I think about it and price check and call you back tomorrow?
Alec:
I wish. So it's like I've got a couple of slots available for tomorrow. Like we start working in the afternoon. So I'm trying to make sure I keep my tech miles busy. If we could get done while I'm here. Like I even throw in the garage. You keep your Lamborghini in there, right? Of course.
Stan:
So like they actually do have a Porsche.
Alec:
Which one? The Whittingtons. Whoever's next to you.
Stan:
I don't remember the last name. The last name escapes me right now.
Alec:
Are they on the right side?
Stan:
On this side to this one.
Alec:
Okay, cool.
Stan:
They have a Porsche. I have, I have a Civic in a, in an Odyssey.
Alec:
Sick.
Stan:
It's a very practical car.
Alec:
I've got a 2012 Ford Focus. So I'm with you. So in the garage though, the reason I bring that up, you'll get like the cobwebs in there as well. We'll sweep and treat. All that in addition to like the porch. Usually that would be like a $30 add-on per treatment if we can get it done like while I'm here. Because it saves us like just a lot more convenient. Makes more sense. Like we'll throw in the garage for free. Like maybe anytime you guys want. Does that sound fair?
Stan:
I'm still going to pass for tonight. I'll think about it. I'll talk with my wife and sure, I can call you tomorrow. And if I miss tomorrow...
Alec:
I've never met a woman who likes the bugs. Seemed like she was pretty down. She's like, oh, I want to ask him, like to make it a no-brainer. As long as you don't like post it on Facebook so people don't call me like mad I give you a different deal or whatever. Like our customer density. Like I said, we're done. Like all these stars or customers in your development. Like if we can get you guys done tomorrow, like, I'll even take another hundred dollars off that first one.
Kid:
Okay.
Alec:
So do it for just 149 as well.
Kid:
Okay.
Alec:
Can I make that work?
Stan:
I'm not agreeing to it right now.
Alec:
The thing is too, like we wait till later. It's like you're going to get busy. I'm going to get busy. Just like doesn't usually like happen. And it's like, I know you've got better stuff to do than come out here like every week and like sweep down the cobwebs. Like it's just so buggy in the neighborhood with the spiders because of all the trees. Like try it out. Like I'm confident enough too that like I can earn your business and you guys will probably keep us for long term. Usually we do that 18-month program, but it's like try saddle. Even shorten it just to a year. So it's five treatments, literally 149 a pop for like everything, including like in the basement. And if you guys get stuff popping up in between treatments, like after a busy workday, that way you don't have to take care of it. You just have us come out and then we'll call you before every quarter we service the home. What's the best number to get you at?
Stan:
614-596-5333.
Alec:
Awesome. And what was your name, sir?
Stan:
Stan.
Alec:
Cool. And your last name?
Stan:
Weasler. W-H-E-A-S-L-E-R. Cool.
Alec:
And then do you want to do in the basement for you guys tomorrow too or just exterior?
Stan:
I don't want to do anything tomorrow.
Alec:
I'm not biased at all. But I think we should do it.
Stan:
As a neutral party who has no fast.
Alec:
That's right. It's not like it's a commission-only job or anything.
Kid:
Yeah.
Alec:
It's like, I mean it's just pest control, Stan. It's like a year. It's not crazy. Like we do the garage, we get all the cobwebs up here. We'll do the, the basement out back too. Do you have a patio deck?
Stan:
Yeah, we got a patio.
Kid:
Cool.
Alec:
The patio area too. A lot of times that's where you get like I took care of the Shorts today on the corner. I don't know if you know like the Shorts, they're getting some of these little red like spider mites there. It's like we'll spray the patio to take care of that. That's usually an add-on as well. We'll just do that for free and too because it's like I'm competing against the guy. His name's Calvin. Whoever wins today's got a chance to win like new driver set worth like 1500 bucks. So that's why I'm out knocking doors at 8pm on a Monday.
Stan:
So I appreciate the enthusiasm and the...
Alec:
Hustle but because now too it's like like give us a shot. I'll even drop you down. Like this is. This is usually like switch over pricing. If you had like a service like Terminix and we're trying to like be competitive or whatever. Like I can drop your quarters down. We'll do it for just 129. So it's 129 a pop for literally everything. And then you guys have issues.
Stan:
We'll take care of it.
Alec:
Is it that cheap?
Stan:
Would you give me a job for a year tonight?
Alec:
I won't.
Stan:
If you want to give me a call tomorrow and see if I've changed my mind overnight.
Alec:
Sure. What. What would change between tonight and tomorrow, you think? Stan?
Stan:
Talking to my wife, seeing she thinks it's actually a good idea instead of sending me out here to be the guy who says no instead of making her do it.
Alec:
That's funny. Here, go ahead and ask her real quick if you guys. Because if you don't want to do it like I mean that's not a big deal. Like it's whatever. We've done a lot of homes. But if you guys want to do it like you might as well do it now because I can get you scheduled. So run it by her. Tell her. Did you honestly cut me down?
Stan:
I will be back out in 30 seconds.
Alec:
Sounds good. All right.
Stan:
You're actually lucky because we're being annoyed by ants right now. So we're gonna do it for. We'll do the year.
Kid:
Cool.
Alec:
You should have told me that before. I would have charged you more. Must be a sales guy too.
Kid:
Yeah.
Alec:
What's your email, Stan?
Stan:
Weasler. My last name.32mail.com.
Alec:
Cool. Are they black ants? Red ants?
Stan:
Black ants.
Alec:
Okay. Unlike the that this.
Stan:
We've been seeing them. They're coming from our bathroom to like behind this. Oh massive blue spray.
Alec:
A lot of people are getting ants now too, so. Cool. We'll make sure we take care of that. Let me type this all in for you. So what kind of work do you do? Are you in sales? No, I just could negotiate.
Stan:
I had the. The worst experience of my life was. Well no, the worst experience of my life is I let a. A Dyson salesman into my house. Not realizing that them cleaning your carpet for free is a three-hour sales pitch. Trying to sell you a $2,000 vacuum. What the heck? Not Dyson, Kirby.
Alec:
Weird sales pitch.
Stan:
Yeah. So they go in, they clean your carpet, they. They show you that their vacuum is better than your vacuum. And it is.
Kid:
Sure.
Stan:
And they try to convince you that you know you're going to have to eventually replace your couch because you're not cleaning it very well. And they convince yourself that this couch, well all the things you're have to replace the new carpets. It's basically free to get this two thousand dollar vacuum. I don't want your vacuum. Go away. They just won't leave your house.
Alec:
That's the weirdest thick pitch. What I love about pest control. It's like, it's like a 10-minute thing. It's like if you have bugs or take care of them, if you want it cool. If not cool. Yeah, it's funny. Well, I'm glad I wasn't as annoying as the Dyson. Probably close but. So just to double check, I've got Stan. Weasler 950 Walker Woods Lane. Email, phone. Butt foot.
Kid:
Good.
Stan:
Is there an agreement to. We're signing up for a year somewhere.
Kid:
Come into my email, I'll show you all that.
Alec:
Yep. So it's all right to your email. So it shows. Take care of ants, spiders, hornets, wasps, a bunch of other bugs. If you see any come out for free. So I said 12-month agreement, five treatments. Like I said, the reason there's five. We come out quarterly. The first quarter is the most important. We come back again in a month to break the egg cycle.
Kid:
Okay.
Alec:
And your initial one too. I discounted from 3 grand to 129. Like I said, just 12 months. It says it again somewhere. I think it's just up here. 12 months. If you cancel early, we just put a lien on your house. Just kidding. We just want to.
Stan:
I just watched. Did you watch John Oliver at all? So John Oliver, he does a comedy show.
Kid:
Okay.
Stan:
But he was talking about the Pace is the name for it where they basically put solar panels on your house as a tax lien on your house. And a lot of people are losing their houses because they.
Alec:
You.
Stan:
First of all, you have the discipline to not spend your savings as you get them.
Alec:
Yes.
Stan:
And you get a massive. Basically you pay for by having higher property taxes.
Alec:
It's sick.
Kid:
Yeah.
Alec:
And solar not too. The tax credits are getting. I have buddies that do solar door to door. And it's like some guys make bank like big, big money. But it's like that industry is getting phased out because of the.
Stan:
Well, and if you live in Las Vegas, sure. But solar panels in your house, it makes sense. We don't get enough sun here to make it make sense.
Alec:
Exactly. But obviously we're not going to put a lien on your house. Canceling early. It'd be 249 bucks. But if you see Bug, just have us come out for free. And then this is just for your autograph. And then I'll send this right to your email. So then that just sent to Weezer2@gmail. Go ahead and refresh. Just double check that came through. And then my tech will be here tomorrow sometime between 1 and 3.
Kid:
Okay.
Alec:
And then you should see two emails now. One with that schedule and one with.
Stan:
The say that copy scam.
Kid:
Copy your pest control upcoming service appointment. That's good.
Alec:
And then do you want to use debit or credit?
Stan:
I'll use credit.
Alec:
Awesome. You have that with you?
Stan:
I do not, but I will. I will dack another 15 cents.
Alec:
Sounds good.

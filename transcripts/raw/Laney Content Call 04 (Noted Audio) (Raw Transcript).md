[00:00:00]
**Laney:**
See?

[00:00:01]
**Bradley:**
So, yeah. So a couple of things we could do today I wanted to show you. So I have Arno still working on the database right now. There's 82 posts. So I downloaded all of them. I can show you just kind of the properties of what it is. But then, yeah, so I have a template. So hopefully that should be done by the end of the day or have at least a decent day ready for you to go for next week. So. And was it just social? Was it just Instagram that you were planning on doing? Like, that was the main thing you wanted the blogs converted into?

[00:00:35]
**Laney:**
Yeah, like, I just need that paragraph because then when I could see a topic in progress. I'm sorry, when I see a topic, I can look at all yours and go, okay, I just talked about nail trimming, and I'm gonna relate. I'm gonna put the link on this blog. And there's a little paragraph because on the stories I can link it to the picture itself, but on the reels and the posts, I have to put it in the bio. I have to put it in the paragraph. So all I have to do is copy and paste what you have.

[00:01:09]
**Bradley:**
Okay. So you said you can make sure that link in the. In the reels, but not in the actual posts.

[00:01:18]
**Laney:**
So if it's a reel, basically the same thing on Instagram. I'll do the picture and I'm going to hit next. It's paragraph form. So what I would do is take whatever you did, copy and paste it. It'll have that paragraph. And then we have to work on hashtags. And it's supposed to have hashtags. So what I want it to have is I want it to have a paragraph and then it will have the link to that blog. So you need to put that link in there and then it'll have the hashtags.

[00:01:51]
**Bradley:**
Okay, sweet. Yeah, because I have. Let's see right now.

[00:01:56]
**Laney:**
So if you go to any of my reels, you should be able to see most of the reels will have a paragraph and hashtags on it.

[00:02:09]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. Yeah. Right now, the fields that I have. So I basically split up in three categories. So we have, like, planned, right, which is just upcoming. Then we have published, which is gonna be the most of them. And then there's an in progress category as well. So, yeah, then we have a main topic, subtopics link to the post, and then there's a few more different things as brainstorming with Arno. So we're looking at what is it?

[00:02:37]
**Laney:**
And then we can. We can do hashtags.

[00:02:39]
**Bradley:**
Hashtags as well.

[00:02:40]
**Laney:**
That'll be awesome.

[00:02:43]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. Let's see.

[00:02:49]
**Laney:**
So now go to. While you're on Instagram, go to this. Go to my instagram and let's go to a real. I'm gonna try to. Let me see.

[00:03:08]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:03:08]
**Laney:**
I'll tell you which ones. Scroll. Oops. Hold on, hold on. Do you have it? Okay, there. Keep going. Let's see. Scroll down, scroll down. Okay, scroll down again. Can't tell these are posts or what. Okay, see the one right there with the dog? Let's click that. No, the one like doodles.

[00:03:47]
**Bradley:**
Uh huh.

[00:03:47]
**Laney:**
Let's click that and then see how it says. Is there more to that? Where it says find has a link.

[00:03:59]
**Bradley:**
Right here.

[00:04:02]
**Laney:**
Because that's what I put on there. I don't know if these are stories or posts, so it's not that page.

[00:04:14]
**Bradley:**
Okay. I think those are posts. So are you talking about, like these?

[00:04:19]
**Laney:**
Yeah, I gotta see one that I haven't done it in a couple days, so scroll down more because that's this weekend. Okay. Boom. Stop. Look at me. I got my bing in my hand at eight in the morning. Good for me. Good for me. Let's click that one with the overalls. Yeah. There. Okay. So I just put something. I always know the quality of lifestyle dogs. But myself I enjoy. I don't know what it says there. Love what you do, do what you love and be happy. And then my paragraph, that's what I typed in there. And then I copy and pasted. We pride ourselves in. This is where you come in. This is what you're doing. So I typed in a little whatever I was feeling that in that moment of doing that video, I can't read through your faces. Like, oh, I guess I move your face. So it says, I know I always say quality lifestyle, quality dogs, but I myself get to enjoy the quality lifestyle with my dogs and my beautiful area. I get to live in, being busy keeping. Okay. Da da da. And then it says, love what you do, do what you love and be happy. How do you like that for positive words?

[00:05:48]
**Bradley:**
There you go.

[00:05:49]
**Laney:**
Then your Arnold stuff will be where I just want to copy and paste. We pride ourselves in. Blah, blah, blah, blah. I use that 190 percent of the time because I don't have a plug and I want to. That's what you're doing. And then those hashtags are all underneath. So how yours would lay out is, if it related to a blog, I would have. After the paragraph, after it says, breeding medium f one non shedding assy doodles. I always put that in there because people don't know what size I'm breeding. So I always have that at the end of everything. So at the end of every Arnold thing you're doing, it needs to say, watch our free range dogs here at fine and dandy Aussie doodles. Quality lifestyle, quality dogs breeding medium f. One's shared. Yeah. There and then. I think I do want to say something about, you know, um, raising the bar in breeding, you know, raising the dog, raising the bar in. I hate saying breeding business, but raising the bar in. I raise the bar in what I do. I don't know. I got. I got to figure out what I want. I hate the word breeding, but I. Yeah, whatever.

[00:07:07]
**Bradley:**
We'll figure it out. So, yeah, I think that's what it was gonna be. I was just going to put, like a little call to action there at the bottom, too, whether that it's like, hey, go check out whatever this week's newsletter link is.

[00:07:19]
**Laney:**
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

[00:07:21]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:07:23]
**Laney:**
So, you know, if. If it's about quality lifestyle, we may. You may have a blog about what I do and how I do it. And it could go. It could talk about me. We could have a blog about me. So when it's something like this, when I'm just talking about what I do and I'm happy, if we had a blog about me and what I'm doing, we could click it. I could have used that picture to that blog.

[00:07:44]
**Bradley:**
Right. Okay, sweet.

[00:07:48]
**Laney:**
So that kind of shows you what that looks like.

[00:07:50]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, that makes sense. So you said you want it. You didn't want to include this little blurb at the end here that yells.

[00:07:59]
**Laney:**
At the end of every single one of your Arnold. Yeah.

[00:08:02]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Okay, cool. That makes sense.

[00:08:07]
**Laney:**
Yeah. But there's something I need to put in there. And you think about it because I am raising the bar. I used to feel uncomfortable saying it, but now when so many people come and they've dealt with other breeders, I am raising the bar. What I'm doing is changing a standard of the breeding business. The way my dogs have the opportunity to play and not be locked up all day. The way they have the opportunity. Just their lifestyle and how I do what I'm doing it is raising the standard of the breeding business. And I'm. I feel like I'm leading the pack in that, but I don't know how to word that. That doesn't sound. It's okay to sound a little sure of yourself, but I don't want to sound conceited.

[00:08:52]
**Bradley:**
Right?

[00:08:53]
**Laney:**
Tell Arnold that, would you?

[00:08:54]
**Bradley:**
Tell Arnold because you want to, you want to like position your customer as the hero and position yourself as the guide.

[00:09:01]
**Laney:**
Oh, you're so good.

[00:09:06]
**Bradley:**
Didn't come from yet. Reading books and stuff.

[00:09:14]
**Laney:**
Do you read a lot?

[00:09:16]
**Bradley:**
A decent amount, yeah.

[00:09:18]
**Laney:**
Good for you. So this is my sleeping hour. Just so you know. You are interrupting my nap. It's okay.

[00:09:26]
**Bradley:**
I'll try to make it exciting. Okay, cool. That makes sense. And I, and I did have some questions for you for this next blog post we can go over.

[00:09:34]
**Laney:**
I have another job for you too.

[00:09:36]
**Bradley:**
Yeah?

[00:09:38]
**Laney:**
You ready?

[00:09:39]
**Bradley:**
What's that?

[00:09:41]
**Laney:**
I have another job for you too, when you're ready.

[00:09:44]
**Bradley:**
Do you want to mention it now or later?

[00:09:47]
**Laney:**
It's entirely up to you. This is your meeting.

[00:09:49]
**Bradley:**
Okay. We can save it for the end if you want. We can go through these questions and then we'll do that. So let's see here. This will work.

[00:10:12]
**Laney:**
Don't want to interrupt your golfing appointment.

[00:10:15]
**Bradley:**
Oh, yeah. It's important times.

[00:10:18]
**Laney:**
It is.

[00:10:20]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so we had questions for this one. Okay, cool. So, so I know the topic for this one was basically, and I saw you written a couple blog posts that were somewhat related to this. I didn't go through all, I didn't go through all of them, but I just saw the title is kind of related. But I was thinking just from your text and I, and I threw those to Arno and asked him just to help me sort of make an outline of what would be good to focus on. I think there's like two main focuses, which is one's the bigger picture, which is just getting ready for your puppy's arrival in general, regardless of what season it is. And then the second like narrower focus is on. Okay. Specifically what is different during this one should be.

[00:11:12]
**Laney:**
This one should be about. This one is. This is good. We're going with this is good. And we can do it like this. But this one is why I'm offering a one time a year discount I on my puppies that will be ready for Christmas.

[00:11:34]
**Bradley:**
Right? Yes.

[00:11:36]
**Laney:**
So we have to figure out, you know, a lot of people are going, well, why, you know, why are we offering this? You know, why are you discounting your dog? Is it because of economy? It's because you have too many and it's nothing. It's the convenience of getting that. Making all the arrangements to get your dog to you is hard during Christmas season. It's hard, yeah. So that's what I want to focus on. So this would be a blog that you know, I wouldn't use all the time, but I would definitely, I could refer to it when, you know, you know, picking up your dog during a busy holiday season, what's, you know. Cause then if it's holiday, I can use it for 4 July. I can use it for. Cause puppies come at different times. They don't all come every Christmas, but whether it's Thanksgiving. Yeah.

[00:12:32]
**Bradley:**
Do you want to make it so, like, big picture is get ready for your puppy's arrival in general? Second, focus is.

[00:12:37]
**Laney:**
So it's not about the puppy's arrival. It's about them making the arrangements for them picking up their puppy or their puppy travel. So it's more about them preparing to get a dog during a busy travel holiday weekend is more of the focus.

[00:12:59]
**Bradley:**
Okay. And then the only time we really talk about Christmas, then I assume would just be, like, in the part that talks about the discount.

[00:13:10]
**Laney:**
Yes.

[00:13:10]
**Bradley:**
Like, the Christmas wouldn't necessarily be in the headline or, like, the main point.

[00:13:15]
**Laney:**
Yes. We can put in there is we can put, you know, 2024. I can put it. I can put a button, especially, like, when I do the post, I'll put a coupon button on it, you know, for 2024. But then you say, for example, this year in 2024, our puppies happen to line up to be ready to go home for Christmas, you know, so I don't know. I mean, those are, you know, you know, I'm going with that.

[00:13:46]
**Bradley:**
Mm hmm.

[00:13:52]
**Laney:**
So that, yeah, it's more about. The thing about this blog is I like my blog is to be not dated.

[00:14:00]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:14:01]
**Laney:**
But this blog is gonna be a little dated because I'm gonna have four to five litters, which is going to be anywhere from 28 to 35 dogs. Puppies, which will put me up to over 50 dogs on property.

[00:14:18]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:14:19]
**Laney:**
Very stressful. So I just want, you know, like, for instance, if I want to go somewhere and I want to do something for the holiday, I need to figure out how to navigate that, you know, with people coming in and out of it benefits me as well as it benefits the customer to put their deposit down early so that we can start planning ahead of what the holiday season is going to look like in them making arrangements to pick up their dog. There's the key line right there.

[00:14:54]
**Bradley:**
Right. Okay. Let me just put it here.

[00:15:00]
**Laney:**
You know, and we can do getting ready for your puppy, you know, 2.0, because we've already done that before in a blog, but I learn more every year. And so that that blog does need to be updated. And we can do that, you know, a month down the road. But for now, I want to have this one ready to go so that I can start getting deposits.

[00:15:20]
**Bradley:**
Right. Okay, that makes sense. So, yeah, I guess we'll revise the headline. But getting ready for your new puppies, rifles, more so, like, preparing to bring your puppy home during the holiday season. Okay. So. And then I came.

[00:15:37]
**Laney:**
These questions may not be in line with what we wanting, but just to give you some ideas, and if you want to have Arnold rewrite questions to give you an idea, it would be things like, you know, there's going to be questions involved on will we be flying? There's three ways we do, four ways we do it. We either fly the dog to them in specific airports, and we can list those. Or they fly in here.

[00:16:08]
**Bradley:**
Mm hmm.

[00:16:11]
**Laney:**
Or they drive in to pick up the dog. And the last one is people sometimes will fly in and then drive back. And so with holidays being a season, this advanced travel needs to be arranged, especially if airline tickets are required.

[00:16:30]
**Bradley:**
Right. And how, like, how far ahead of time should people usually prepare for, you know, like, getting their airplane tickets or.

[00:16:39]
**Laney:**
Oh, they should be getting their tickets by 1 November. They need, I mean, when the bell, the puppies are going to be born in October. So I'll have go home dates. So they should be booking their tickets by end of, you know, starting the end of October.

[00:16:53]
**Bradley:**
Mm hmm. And planning on picking them up when exactly.

[00:16:58]
**Laney:**
I have to tell. I'll know when they're born. Let me look at my calendar as it stands right now. Let me tell you. Hold on. September, October 16 through the 29th. So let's go as early as the 16th. Let's say we have, let's say we have some born the 19th, the 20th. Let's go to 20th. 1234-5678 they can, they can start being picked up as early as December 15.

[00:17:37]
**Bradley:**
Most likely December 15. Okay.

[00:17:40]
**Laney:**
As early as.

[00:17:44]
**Bradley:**
And as.

[00:17:46]
**Laney:**
That's going to be dependent. And then it's in parentheses. That's, that date is going to depend on when the puppies are born.

[00:17:52]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:17:52]
**Laney:**
The puppies cannot go anywhere until they're eight weeks old.

[00:17:56]
**Bradley:**
Mm hmm. Gotcha.

[00:18:00]
**Laney:**
That's putting puppies. That's putting puppies being born on October 20. But they're the in line to be born anywhere from October 16 to October 29. So I'm just kind of, I'm giving you a medium date.

[00:18:15]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. No, I think it's good to just have, like, a guesstimate range because I don't, I don't expect you to predict the exact day. But. And then I'll add that in there, like expected sort of this range, but it's subject to change, you know?

[00:18:30]
**Laney:**
Yeah.

[00:18:31]
**Bradley:**
And then I. So as far as I know, you mentioned the discount and the deposit. Like, what are the specifics of that? Like, do you have a certain.

[00:18:38]
**Laney:**
So one of the things I wanted to know is I don't publicly put my prices out on Instagram or any social media. I want serious buyers and serious inquirers. And what a serious buyer and serious Inquirer is someone who has taken the time to vet me, look at my website, follow my social media, get to know me, and then go through the application process. Once they start the application process. So one of the questions would be, where do I find the prices for the puppies?

[00:19:13]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:19:14]
**Laney:**
And then that's the question. I don't post them online. I don't talk about pricing online on any social media thing. They are on my website. And the reason I do that is I know a serious buyer is not only going to look at me on Instagram or Facebook, but they're also going to take the time to go to my website to learn about me. Because as much as I vet them to make sure that they are good dog owners, they will be a good fit for my dogs. I'm hoping that they also do the same thing and read about me and look at my website and look at my profile and look at all the things that we're doing and look at our blogs and educate ourselves. So if they start doing those things, if they start doing those things and they go to the application process and they go, hey, I do want a dog. The minute they hit that button, my price listing is in there. So any of the discount is going to be 500 off of that price list because that's my 2024 pricing.

[00:20:17]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Gotcha. So, I mean, you could basically say if you're a. As far as pricing goes, you know, you can go to this link. Link, whether it's linked to the blog, links to the website in the bio, to see more on pricing.

[00:20:32]
**Laney:**
Yeah, yeah. If you wanted the pricing, it's in the application. But I would hope, you know, I encourage you to also go through the website and get to know me and look at and educate, you know, and prepare yourself with the articles that we post in our blogs.

[00:20:48]
**Bradley:**
Right. Okay. And then let's see. So you said it's $500, it's $500 off. And then is there like a certain time range or like, any terms or conditions, requirements?

[00:21:02]
**Laney:**
The offer expires October 31.

[00:21:05]
**Bradley:**
Okay. So anytime between now and October 31. And they are. And are these for, like, any dog, or is it specific ones in this litter, or how does that work?

[00:21:23]
**Laney:**
No, it will be. This is for the ones that are going, because I'm putting training into the other ones, the older dogs. I'm putting training into them. When I put training into them, the price of the dog goes up because we're training it now. So this will be the dogs that are all being born in the month of October, and that will be ready to go to homes for the holiday season.

[00:21:49]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Gotcha. Let's see. So are those. And are those ones on your, or. No, can't be.

[00:21:59]
**Laney:**
Nope. They haven't been born yet.

[00:22:00]
**Bradley:**
They're not born. So.

[00:22:03]
**Laney:**
I was trying to be a miracle.

[00:22:05]
**Bradley:**
Right. Okay. And so let's see. So they fill out the application, and I'm just also.

[00:22:19]
**Laney:**
Yeah, they need to read my policies inside the policies so that they're aware of what I expect of them and also what they expect of me. And that goes from anything to do with how to feed the dog, how to care for the dog, time spent with the dog during its puppy stages, things like that. Proper care, proper immunizations, things like that.

[00:22:43]
**Bradley:**
Right. And I did have a question, too. So, like, would. Would it be crazy to do the $500 discount also on, like, the older ones that are available just, like, across the board? Because. Because it's a dollar 500 discount, not necessarily the same price I offer it.

[00:23:01]
**Laney:**
Anyway, just because I want them gone.

[00:23:02]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:23:03]
**Laney:**
I just need to put. Find a good way to word it.

[00:23:05]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:23:06]
**Laney:**
Something like, you know, if going through interviewing with me and going through this process, if you fall in love with one of our toddlers here that are on property, they're also available. That promotion can be applied towards one of those dogs.

[00:23:27]
**Bradley:**
Okay, sweet.

[00:23:30]
**Laney:**
So promotion applied, right? Yeah. I guess a good way of putting that in your blog is sometimes as people are going down and start talking about what's involved in getting a new puppy, sometimes they all of a sudden remember, wow, it's a lot. It's like getting a new baby again. And as they want a dog. I've had clients go, you know what? Now that I'm here, and I thought I was gonna get a baby, a toddler is sounding a lot easier for transitioning into my home right now. So I'd like to have an older puppy. And that's how they start going into it. They. They start. We start going through all of the things that are required and they're going to chew, they're going to lose teeth. They're going to do this, they're going to pee on your floor. You know, we start going through everything, and all of a sudden they're going, how long does that dog hold it splatter? And how long is that? You know, and all of a sudden they realize that the older one, and I've had a lot of people switch over to an older dog just for that reason.

[00:24:28]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:24:28]
**Laney:**
So that's also, you know, if we can put that in there, that'd be good.

[00:24:32]
**Bradley:**
Okay. And I'm curious because, like, do people, since the puppies aren't born yet, do, is it common for people to just be like, okay, put down a deposit. I know I want a puppy. Then they see it for the very first time, pick it up.

[00:24:45]
**Laney:**
So they want it because they want a lot of people on a specific sex, a specific eye color, a specific coat marking, a specific coat color. And so the ones that are very, very definitive on what they want, they want to get their done so they can have the first pick of certain litters.

[00:25:09]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:25:10]
**Laney:**
So the incentive of putting your deposit down is to get the specifics that you want in your puppy.

[00:25:16]
**Bradley:**
Okay, gotcha. That makes sense. And let's see. So can you, I was just thinking if you could give an example. Well, first off, like, when it comes to planning the logistics for pickup, delivery, obviously you gotta have. So you have flights. What else should you have in your mind? Like a simple checklist? What do you need to put on your calendar?

[00:25:36]
**Laney:**
What are some, with the dog? They, they need to come with their harness, with their collar, with all the supplies for flying, as well as a puppy carrier.

[00:25:50]
**Bradley:**
Okay, gotcha. And are there any things that people like, any challenges or things that people don't anticipate?

[00:25:57]
**Laney:**
We really encourage them to avoid long. What are they called? Layovers.

[00:26:08]
**Bradley:**
Mm hmm.

[00:26:09]
**Laney:**
Because the dog can't go to the bathroom in the public puppy areas because they haven't received their full series of shots until, you know, if they have still have two more series of shots that need to receive as they grow. So, you know, we try to get them to avoid long layovers because then they've got to find a way to have the dog go potty privately somewhere in the airport. And they can't use the pet areas.

[00:26:38]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:26:41]
**Laney:**
We try to make sure if they're flying that if a flight gets canceled due to weather, see, weather's a big deal in the winter too, due to weather. We need to make sure there's a lot of flights going afterwards so they can get on the next flight. But I have people, if they're leaving at nine at night, there's not going to be a connecting flight. And if their flight gets canceled, they're stuck in an airport somewhere all night with a dog.

[00:27:07]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:27:09]
**Laney:**
So these are all the things during Christmas time that, and I'm not, I'm not saying these things to raise anxiety. I'm saying these things because these are the things that happen commonly during the holidays. And so if you plan well and you plan Smarteen, you're able to kind of avoid some of these things.

[00:27:30]
**Bradley:**
And kiddie. Tell me, can you tell me. You don't have to like it, obviously, names or anything, but like a story or an anecdote of someone who, like a client who was ill prepared and, like, didn't anticipate these things and how that went for them. Just kind of the, like, emotions that brought up what the negative things were canceled.

[00:27:49]
**Laney:**
They, they got all the way to, um, Charlotte because a lot of the connecting flights where we are in Charlotte, and the airline just canceled the flight. They didn't reroute them anywhere else, and the people were stuck there. The happy story was the people were very, very easygoing and they had the type of budget that they were able to say, it's okay, we'll get a hotel for the night, or it's okay, we'll just move over to another airlines. But some people are on really tight budgets and don't have that luxury to just go get a hotel sometimes. This is everything. This is the thing they've been saving up for. And so, because I'm very sensitive to that because that's been my budget. I don't want this in my story, but that's in my budget. Like, when people would, I would get panicked packing and I'd have people that would have money, like friends, you know, married friends. They go, why do you get so worried, Lane? To worry. Whatever you don't have, you can buy, right? I just wanted to punch him in the face. No, I can't, because every penny I went, went to this trip. So, you know, so I try to be very sensitive to people. I don't pry in what their financial is, but for her, her story was okay, and they were very easy going. And they found a nice hotel that was pet friendly, and they came back and they went and had breakfast, and they got on the next flight and they lived happily ever after. But those stories don't happen for people that are on budgets. They don't yeah, they have to sleep on the floor in an airport. It causes a lot of anxiety, a lot of emotions. It sucks. So, you know, those are some of the things. So we always encourage direct flights if possible.

[00:29:33]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:29:35]
**Laney:**
A lot of times that's not possible from my little airport. And I'm not trying to scare them away from traveling. I just want. I'm joking on my candy. I just want them to be able to, as they're planning their flights, maybe get the earliest flight in. So if something does happen, they have time to plan, and not everything's closed, things like that.

[00:30:01]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I think that's more helpful. Things to be aware of. And people have to have to see the negative outcome potential, one, to actually care.

[00:30:09]
**Laney:**
And then the other thing is, we have the ability to fly the dogs to specific airports all the way as far as Denver and Las Vegas. We have the ability to do that. But I meet the people at the airport and hand off the dog. But if for some reason the clients aren't late or late and they're not there on time and we miss our connecting flights, they have to pay to get us home. Yeah, they have to pay to get us in a hotel. So there's just a lot of variables. So, you know, we just. The planning, you know, that's why we tell people, you need to be at the airport sitting, waiting an hour before we left. Because if I got Betty sitting, thinking, so happy that she's there on time, see, because I communicate. They call me when they're at the airport. My girl is flying them. And I had a lady that said, we're here an hour before, it's great. Okay. I said, okay, great. And it was Vegas airport. And I said, what terminal are you at? They were at the international one. I says, you need to get on that train right now, and you need to get. You're at the wrong terminal. And if she was last minute, she would have missed it. And what we do is we take the dog and turn around and go home. Yeah, but you don't want to say that because we don't want, you know, but that's how critical it is, so.

[00:31:41]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:31:41]
**Laney:**
And then we just say, we've done that. We've done this long enough, and we've had many, many 99% successful stories, and we've had 1% hard stories due to airline cancellations. And so we're offering you information based on that 1%. But we offer you great advice on the 99%. And it's because of that advice that we can keep it at a 99%.

[00:32:07]
**Bradley:**
Right. And so could you describe, in contrast, what does this story look like for someone who actually does prepare and does make a smoothen transition? Like how?

[00:32:18]
**Laney:**
Oh, y'all, sometimes. Sometimes they have a quick turnover, and we meet them at the Asheville airport, and we hand the dog off to them, and they turn right around and get on their connecting flight, and they have, like, a. An hour turnaround. We meet them at the airport. We give them their dog. We sit and visit with them. We answer their questions. Boom. And they turn around and go home. Others may have a longer layover and maybe come in in the morning and don't have to go in the afternoon. And many of them have rented cars and come out and spent the day with me just to see and to learn and to be here. And a lot of them actually book their flights because they want to see what we're about. And so the best success stories are the ones that plan to come in early. They spend the day here with me. We hang out, we talk about the puppy, we introduce them to their puppy. We give them any helpful hints, and then we make. And then they go back to their airport. They rent a car, and. And they get on their flight, and they live happily ever after. And they have no issues because it's been planned that way. So that's the successful story for those people who are flying in. And then the successful story is for those that we're flying to when we're bringing the puppy, we meet them at the airport. We meet them in a specific location. They're there. We get to greet them, we get to talk to them. We take a few pictures. They've already been prepared what to expect. It's a very quick turnaround. We have to hurry and get back on the plane. We make sure that puppy is in the right hands, and then we turn around and go home.

[00:33:49]
**Bradley:**
So those are the sweet.

[00:33:52]
**Laney:**
Yeah.

[00:33:53]
**Bradley:**
And. Okay, cool. And I think this one, this next one, number seven, we kind of covered a little bit, but because I know you mentioned, so, what are the specific situations people find themselves in when they are trying to bring a puppy home during Christmas time or the season? I know it's kind of this one specifically, too. Like, what's. What's different about this person? What situation are they, and what do they have in mind that is different than someone just picking them up any time of year?

[00:34:25]
**Laney:**
A lot of times, people don't want to travel on New Year's, you know, Christmas Eve or the day before, you know, New Year's Eve, because travel is big New Year's Eve. And the 20, you know, from the 22nd to the 24th, travel is high at its highest. So some people will, you know, we make sure all goes well. We make sure the transition is very easy. But some people will want to keep that surprise and they'll have puppies stay with grandma or auntie or somebody and spend those first couple of days with them, which is not critical. I mean, not horrible at all. So, you know, we rely on the people to put that dog in the best care while it's waiting to be a surprise.

[00:35:12]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:35:12]
**Laney:**
So some people have. Didn't want to travel, and they go and have the dog stay somewhere for a couple of days so that the dog can be presented on Christmas morning.

[00:35:26]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha.

[00:35:28]
**Laney:**
Some people, we've had some people come here and we've had Santa Claus here to hand over the puppy. And they came a week early before Christmas, and we made all the arrangements and presented this surprise so that to make that a magical experience, we had Santa come and present the dog. So those are some of.

[00:35:55]
**Bradley:**
Are they for like a kid or a family member or is it like.

[00:36:01]
**Laney:**
It'S usually a family member? Sometimes it's been a wife. You know, it's usually for families. And some people just will do it and pick it up a week before because they're excited because they have the time off, because they, you know, it's Christmas break and the kids get to have time. So they'll pick it up and the family will know about it and they'll pick it up before the kids get out of. There's their track for school, because then everybody gets to be with that puppy before they get back into the school.

[00:36:28]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:36:29]
**Laney:**
There's other. So many different scenarios.

[00:36:32]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha. And so I guess another situation you mentioned is just, I mean, people who want specifically for puppies, they have certain traits that they want. Certain. Whatever color are they one, they want first dibs on a certain puppy that may come from this litter particularly. That's like another. Another situation that might not be like Christmas necessarily, but a reason, like a person who knows from this post, I.

[00:36:58]
**Laney:**
Think one thing I'd want to put in the blog and quitting these things is when I was only breeding two girls, I would have deposits that were a year to year and a half out where I had no openings. And I really didn't like my business being set up that way because there were many people that really wanted one of our dogs, and I couldn't provide it for them when they wanted it, when they needed it. Because I was already sold out before the dogs were even here. People had lost their dogs to illness or divorce or just different things, or they, you know, just different things where they've wanted dogs and they haven't been, you know, for heartbreaking reasons, and they haven't been able to get them. And I didn't like that. I hated having to turn away people and say, you know, you can get on my list, but it's a year out. It's disheartening. And then what happens is then, if they're waiting for a girl, and I'll say, I'm sorry, there aren't any girls in this litter. They're all. They were already taken, then you're pushing them off further. And I didn't like that. That's what it has turned into. And that's why I'm out here, because it allows me to have more girls and more availability. So I usually don't have to take deposits because I will usually, throughout the year, have puppies available. I do take deposits. Like, right now, I've got four deposits for Christmas because those four people are very specific in what they want. So since they're specific, I've got deposits on them. And so because of the amount of dogs that are in different breeding seasons, because I have three to four dogs in two different breeding seasons a year, it allows me to have enough where I don't have to take that many deposits. And it also allows me to always have a puppy available throughout the year, which is great. You know, we have the space. We have the. It's important to say, because I don't want people thinking about puppy mill. We have the space. We have the facility. They get the care. We have a staff. We have everything that those dogs need where I can manage at this level. And that way, when people are looking for that special dog, nine times out of ten have what they need. So I like that. But at Christmas time, a lot of times, people, you know, sales will not sell, but the need for puppy kind of increases. And so I'd like, it'd be nice to get those deposits in so that we can start planning and fine tuning everything so we have a smooth transition during a busy holiday season.

[00:39:51]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. I think we've covered these things, logistics. And I guess because when you say, whenever you do a discount, obviously you want to. You want to do it for, like, a business reason, where you're saying, hey, we're doing a discount not just to, like, decrease our prices, but we're doing it for this reason, and I know you kind of described that, but could you describe that again? Like, what it. What's the benefit to you? Or, like, the business reason that makes it make sense for both you and the client?

[00:40:28]
**Laney:**
Well, it's only. It's actually makes sense for me.

[00:40:31]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:40:33]
**Laney:**
It makes sense for me, but you can word it however you want one, between you and me, I have no money stream between now and December. So if these puppies are born in October and people don't start making deposits on them, I have no money until the day they sell. So taking those $500 deposits carry me through until my big payday. So what happens is, I kind of get little morsels, and then I have a big payday. So, like, right now, I'm on a morsel. So, right now, I'm in a morsel time in my life, and then I need a big payday, and I'm gonna be morsel again. So I need the morsels. But the benefit for me, quote unquote, is if I have 20 puppies that are going home. That's a lot of navigation to figure out how Santa Sleigh is going to get those puppies delivered in the experience that each customer wants. And it's going to take careful managing and careful planning. And I want to be able to accommodate everybody's needs and also educate everybody about traveling during the holidays. And for me, it helps me prepare. And the dollar 500 discount, it's worth it for me because it helps. It gives me a few months advanced notice to start preparing, so we don't have any unfortunate surprises that are hiccups. And so if it makes my business run smoother because I have people already me saying, okay, here's what we have to do, and get them like you're doing to me. You have a list here for me? Lainey, I need you to answer these questions. And so what you're doing keeps me in check. We'll be doing the same thing for them, but they'll have a month advance notice. Hey, have you booked your tickets yet? Hey, you better book them. And some people don't care. I'm not worried. I'm a frequent flyer. I've got a million miles. I've got free, and I just like. And I hate you. But anyway, so there are those people that money doesn't matter, but then there are those that. It's a tight budget, and I just. So I want to give them a list. Like what? I'm looking here at yours, you know, is your food ordered? Nothing makes me more mad when they pick up a food and they don't have a bag of food at home, I lose my mind. So I want to make sure that they have their checklist and I can follow up with them and make sure that checklist is done. But if I have last minute stuff, it creates a little bit of chaos. So what, the $500 creates a better calm during a busy season. And is it worth it? It makes things run efficiently, and that efficiency is valuable enough for me to offer a discount.

[00:43:29]
**Bradley:**
Right. And I think the other benefit to it, at least, like the litter specific is I assume they get better priority on the list of what they want, right?

[00:43:38]
**Laney:**
Absolutely.

[00:43:39]
**Bradley:**
More like a queue where it doesn't matter if you don't want the $500 discount. Cool. But if you wait, you're probably not gonna get your first pick of the type of dog you.

[00:43:47]
**Laney:**
Exactly. Yep.

[00:43:49]
**Bradley:**
Okay, sweet. Um, let's see.

[00:43:53]
**Laney:**
What time do you go? What time is it?

[00:43:56]
**Bradley:**
Uh, 1151. So we got about nine minutes. But, um. And I'm sure you posted on this in the past, but just this little transition. So, like, once a client arrives home with their puppy, what are a couple things they should do that might be specific to, like, this holiday season?

[00:44:16]
**Laney:**
Well, if the tree is up, put a baby fence around it, because the dog will come and find any bright ornament and do that. If you have batteries laying around from kids toys from during Christmas time, pick them up. We don't want them to eat them. Just like a baby. Choke hazards. If you've got tinsel and things laying in low places, they're going to eat it. And tinsel goes out the same way it went in.

[00:44:42]
**Bradley:**
Mm hmm.

[00:44:43]
**Laney:**
It's just a little more messier. So, yeah, those are kind of the things.

[00:44:48]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha. Okay, so, like that. And then potentially, if they need to arrange for the dog to stay at.

[00:44:53]
**Laney:**
Swimming, and also, if you're going to move to a cold area with snow, these dogs will not have experienced snow yet, and so they need to understand the dogs will be just fine and they will acclimatize very well with snow. But you're going to have to go outside with them. So be prepared to go out and stand with your puppy in inclement weather because they're not used to snow.

[00:45:13]
**Bradley:**
Right. Okay.

[00:45:16]
**Laney:**
You just can't, like, throw them out and they're gonna go trolloping like a cute little puppy.

[00:45:20]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:45:20]
**Laney:**
They're gonna stand and, like, go, what the hell?

[00:45:25]
**Bradley:**
Exactly. Okay, cool. So I think that's basically it, right? But, yeah, let's see.

[00:45:39]
**Laney:**
And I'll be doing a post with my Christmas hat on, like, before.

[00:45:45]
**Bradley:**
Mm hmm.

[00:45:46]
**Laney:**
What? The dogs are gonna be wearing a Halloween hat for the deadline. And I'll be wearing a Christmas hat. The puppies.

[00:45:51]
**Bradley:**
Mm hmm.

[00:45:52]
**Laney:**
And I'm gonna be talking about this promotion. So I'll be talking about the same things we're doing, but then I'll have the blog connected to my post also.

[00:46:00]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha. Nice. And then when did you want to plan on Tuesday for this blog? Or what's the. What's the next one that you want to plan on.

[00:46:14]
**Laney:**
Thursday?

[00:46:15]
**Bradley:**
Thursday. Okay.

[00:46:18]
**Laney:**
Sweet. Good deal.

[00:46:22]
**Bradley:**
Good deal. Sounds like a plan. And then the. The. The content database. I'll let you know how many hours it was. I think it was, like, by the time I end up finishing it later today, I want to say it was like, five ish or so.

[00:46:34]
**Laney:**
Okay.

[00:46:35]
**Bradley:**
But then, yeah, I don't want. I don't want you feel stressed about payment or anything coming all at once. But.

[00:46:42]
**Laney:**
No, that's good. I will. On the content. So let's. Let me try to get you paid Monday on that, if it's done.

[00:46:54]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I'll have it. I'll have it finished for you just, like, later tonight.

[00:46:58]
**Laney:**
Okay, well, no worries. And I will say, but do we need to talk about hashtags? A lot of times, those hashtags can be used over and over and over again. You just need to put a few different ones in to do with what the topic was. Like, 95% of them can be the exact same hashtags, and 5% need to be for 10%. Whatever that blog is about.

[00:47:23]
**Bradley:**
Right?

[00:47:24]
**Laney:**
Hashtag dog bath, hashtag dog medicine, hashtag dogs and fleas, or, you know, just whatever.

[00:47:33]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. And I'll put those in because I think they'll kind of align with the topic and then the subtopics and that kind of stuff. I was gonna say, I think not every blog post will have. Trying to think, unless you want me to, but, like, some of the blog posts I noticed were pretty short. Just a few of them. So I'm not sure if you wanted me to necessarily make a caption for that blog post or just my girls.

[00:47:57]
**Laney:**
Get a little bit lazy, so stressed.

[00:47:59]
**Bradley:**
Out because, like, there's not much there and it's only a few of them, but it's like, there's not much content to go off of. So I was wanted to link to that post if it's only a couple paragraphs.

[00:48:09]
**Laney:**
Okay.

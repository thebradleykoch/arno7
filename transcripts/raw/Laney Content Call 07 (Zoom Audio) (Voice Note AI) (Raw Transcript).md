[00:00:00]
**Bradley:**
No, you're good.

[00:00:01]
**Laney:**
I was, I had, I had dogs escape. So I was out chasing dogs.

[00:00:09]
**Bradley:**
Chasing down.

[00:00:11]
**Laney:**
Yeah, I just. There was a. There was a. Just because there was so much construction going. I keep thinking that everything's in, but then tractors in and out and I took tractors in and out and I thought that I sealed the areas and there was an area about 18 inches that wasn't temporarily shut.

[00:00:26]
**Bradley:**
No. Yeah.

[00:00:27]
**Laney:**
Out of six acres, they like, it's like they come out and the little spidey senses goes. So I was dealing with that. So, so I was dealing with that.

[00:00:45]
**Bradley:**
Is that.

[00:00:45]
**Laney:**
Sorry, I apologize.

[00:00:46]
**Bradley:**
Not good. Is that a big thing? Like do dogs escape very often? Are there some escape artists or is that I.

[00:00:53]
**Laney:**
Good questions. The second answer is yes, I have a couple of escape artists that can actually climb an eight foot fence and hop over. And they don't do it every day. They'll do it if they see me going to the river. Like if they see me walking to the river, I have to do it when they're inside because I have two. They all go crazy. But I have two that have the ability to climb and hop over because if I'm at the river there they want to be in. It's like, hey, we're going swimming. So I've got two of those. But it's happening often now because we're still in temporary. Like we have the fencing up, but the gates aren't built yet. So we don't have the gates. And I have six gate openings that have just kind of half assed gating, you know, and the dogs can push it over or they squeeze through because it's not, it's. It's kind of jerry rigged. So.

[00:01:45]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:01:46]
**Laney:**
You know. Yeah. So I thought I had everybody in and I'm like, okay, I'm on time and all of a sudden I look out and I've got three dogs and I'm like, what the heck? So, yeah, I'm good though. Yeah.

[00:01:58]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. Our first, first dog, Albert, he was a. Just a little shih tzu. He was totally an escape artist. Like he would, you'd open the door and he would just kind of pretend like he's sniffing the person's feet and then go run up the street and you'd have to go chase him down or. Yeah.

[00:02:14]
**Laney:**
Anyway, they know, they know. It's funny, I, I have two moms, three moms that can take the chain link fence and flip it, you know, flip it, open the handle and hop out. Like in three seconds, like I'll Shut the gate and I'll turn around there right behind me. And so then what I have to do now is I have to take wire and I have to twist it. So it helped with all of them except one of them. I twisted the wire at the gate at the handle level. And within five minutes she had taken the wire and untwisted it. And she was standing there. So her wire has to be twisted above my head.

[00:02:53]
**Bradley:**
That's crazy.

[00:02:54]
**Laney:**
Yeah.

[00:02:54]
**Bradley:**
I don't know. I don't know how dogs do that with. Without hands. It's like.

[00:02:59]
**Laney:**
They do, man. They're like little monkeys. So, yeah, it's a challenge. But today I'm feeling comfortable. So. Funny story. How old are you? You're what, 30?

[00:03:10]
**Bradley:**
27. Okay, 27.

[00:03:11]
**Laney:**
So I had a 30 year old. 30 or 31 year old. So, you know, close to your age. Come work with me. Because I always. I told you, mom, I says, you know, if Bradley gets bored, he can come and I'll pay him to work for me for a week. You know, he can come and work for me for a week and. But I know you're doing your thing, so I don't know if he'd like that. And I says, oh, he would stay busy. Like, I have enough work that I could work him for a week. Yeah, you know, and maybe he could get away and have fun. This is what I told her when she was here. I said he would have fun, he'd come and hang out here. But I know. So anyway, so this kid who works up the road, he's going out on his own, you know, he just, he's. It's a family business and he's got brothers and he's just like, I'm never going to be the owner of this business. You know, you've got older brothers. And he's like, I'm out. I'm starting my own business, which I totally respect. And this guy can take those gigantic movers that have the, you know, pick up the big rocks, excavators, and he could thread a needle with them. Like you should see him move rocks and you should see. But you know, and since he started his business, I says, do you have some spare days? And I'll pay you to come work for me for a few days. And you know, he goes, yeah, I've got some openings. And I says, because it's hard starting on your own, so why don't you just come work for me? And that way, you know, I'll be filler money. While you're waiting for your next jobs. And so he's been here working for me with me for three days. And he goes, I've never been so tired. And he's like. He's construction dude, you know, he's. Yeah, he's not. He's not sitting at a desk, dude. And he goes, my legs hurt, my body hurts. I'm gonna have to go home and my kids are going to jump on me. And I'm so tired. And he looked at me and he goes, I don't know how you do it. You make it look so easy. And so that made me feel good because I was like, yeah, it's a lot of work. So, you know, if you ever feel like you want to go to the gym in the mountains, we've got the Fine and daddy gym workout here.

[00:05:15]
**Bradley:**
All right, I'll consider it.

[00:05:19]
**Laney:**
Sure you will. All right, I am ready. What is our. What is our topic?

[00:05:27]
**Bradley:**
I have. Yeah, so it's around Christmas, so I. I had Arnold come up with like three ideas and I can just show you like three topic ideas and then I can ask you questions based on these. Based on which one you like best. Because I know we wrote a post previously about. It was like five. It's like five steps to do. To bring your puppy home safely and basically like.

[00:05:48]
**Laney:**
Yeah.

[00:05:49]
**Bradley:**
Logistics of.

[00:05:50]
**Laney:**
Yeah.

[00:05:51]
**Bradley:**
How to prep that and travel. Let me show you this.

[00:06:00]
**Laney:**
Are you staying busy?

[00:06:02]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. Yeah. Are you really not like super busy? I mean, I still have some busy enough time. I can still. But yeah, yeah, that's.

[00:06:15]
**Laney:**
That's good.

[00:06:16]
**Bradley:**
Good.

[00:06:18]
**Laney:**
Was I the one that got the ball rolling?

[00:06:21]
**Bradley:**
You were. You were definitely there at the beginning. You were a good starter. Spark for me. So good, good.

[00:06:28]
**Laney:**
I'm excited for you. Thanks.

[00:06:31]
**Bradley:**
Let me see. How do I.

[00:06:32]
**Laney:**
Sorry.

[00:06:33]
**Bradley:**
I always lose where I'm supposed to screen share.

[00:06:35]
**Laney:**
No worries. I. Believe me, the day. My day is. You can take your time. Oh, cut down a tree yesterday that was bigger than my house. Oh, yeah, that was impressive.

[00:06:50]
**Bradley:**
I gotta call her with like a chainsaw or what?

[00:06:53]
**Laney:**
Oh, need that dog. Yeah, chainsaw.

[00:07:01]
**Bradley:**
Geez, that sounds fun.

[00:07:06]
**Laney:**
Trenches and tractors. It was huge. Okay, so you'll have to read those to me because, you know, I'm blind.

[00:07:11]
**Bradley:**
No, that's fine. So let's see. So it's basically. Basically. So the benefits of bringing a puppy home at Christmas. A insert word, like a magical start for the whole family. This is just sort of a basic thing Arnold gave me, but basically the benefits of bringing a puppy home at Christmas, which includes, you know, the. The family Togetherness or the time people have off of work and how that's like a good start for bringing a puppy home. So that's one option. And then another one is how to make your Christmas.

[00:07:50]
**Laney:**
Oh. Oh, I like that. Lifetime memory. Okay, good. Okay, good.

[00:07:53]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, so yeah, just kind of like the benefits or reasons of bringing a puppy home at Christmas specifically as opposed to just any other time. So another one is how to make your Christmas puppy feel right at home starting day one. So kind of practical starter guide.

[00:08:11]
**Laney:**
I like that. And let's use that for January. I mean, not January. Yeah, let's use that for December. Okay, so I like that. Keep that in mind. Let's do. Because that, because we'll do this one and then as people are getting ready, they're going to read that because, you know, and so that will be a really good. We'll say something at the end of our post. Watch for our next post. Because our next post is going to be about day one of bringing your puppy home, what to expect. So you will write at the end. You know, for those of you who are getting puppies, our next post is going to teach you this or whatever. So I like that. Okay.

[00:08:51]
**Bradley:**
Okay, sweet. So and then this other idea is like a holiday wish list for your Christmas puppy or gifts of love under the tree, such as love that.

[00:09:02]
**Laney:**
Okay.

[00:09:02]
**Bradley:**
So that essentials or training.

[00:09:06]
**Laney:**
That one will be first week of December. Put dates on those. Those are all perfect. But I would put dates on them because I won't remember Bradley. So that's going to be the, the first week in December. The other one is going to be Thanksgiving weekend. Thanksgiving weekend.

[00:09:24]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:09:25]
**Laney:**
And then you and I today, we'll do the number one.

[00:09:28]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:09:29]
**Laney:**
I like it. Good job, Arnold. Too bad you don't get credit for it. Now Arnold gets credit.

[00:09:34]
**Bradley:**
What the heck?

[00:09:36]
**Laney:**
I know, so rude.

[00:09:38]
**Bradley:**
Let me see.

[00:09:39]
**Laney:**
Kind of an egotistical guy, isn't he?

[00:09:42]
**Bradley:**
I mean, he doesn't take all the credit, but I have to give him some credit as well. I can't take all of it, but let me see this. Hold up. And now we're going to do a little magic.

[00:10:10]
**Laney:**
Is this you doing Arnold stuff?

[00:10:12]
**Bradley:**
Yes.

[00:10:16]
**Laney:**
So do you feel the stuff that you do with Arnold is not just software based, that you are giving it. That you are what you do gives it an algorithm? Or do you feel like the software does like it already came ready, made, unboxed, or do you feel what you do in this software makes your product better?

[00:10:37]
**Bradley:**
It's definitely like so you have to learn how to communicate with the AI and like. Or speak its language. So, like, one thing I'm doing right now is I'm actually writing a five day educational email course on like, five mistakes that people make when they're setting up their first personal AI assistant and how to solve them. And so it covers a lot of that. Is. Yeah.

[00:11:01]
**Laney:**
Awesome. Good for you.

[00:11:03]
**Bradley:**
So, okay, here.

[00:11:17]
**Laney:**
While you're doing that, I'm gonna just see if this lady's available. Yeah, it'll only take a second. Hey, it's Lainey. Oh, hi. How are you? This is my other phone. Sorry. Okay. Is this Nicole? Yes. Oh, it doesn't sound like you. Hey, I just saw your post on your puppies. Oh, yeah. So this is. I don't. Does this lady with fine and dandy. I'm the one that buys your dogs. Yes. Okay. I recognize your voice. I wanted to talk about your puppies and I'm wondering if there's a time we can talk today. Sure. Okay. I'm in a meeting right now, but I based off of the ones I've got, and I don't know if you'll remember which ones. I definitely want to get another one like Sophie, who is that red Merle with a gray face, and Dakota. So I know you don't know which ones those are to spuff off their names, but size wise, they're perfect. Okay. My last one, moxie that I got from you. Love her to death. She's a little bit smaller than I want, but I think she's going to be very interesting size when I bring her, when I breed her with the poodle, because they're the same weight. So she's going to be fun. But I can't commit to that size again until I see what she produces. So I know that. And so I'll probably. I'll know more about that in 2025. So can I call you today and talk about the litters you have right now? Sure. I do have a vet coming out at around 1ish. Okay. So maybe sometime after 3, would that work? That would be great. Okay. You doing okay? Yeah. Okay, great. Okay. I did it. I did overdid it. Yeah, you sound. You don't sound like you. That's why I was like, this doesn't sound like Nicole. I. I had my hip replacement surgery and I went off on a hiatus for a little while. No puppies. And then I got all excited and started breeding. Oh, no. And I bred five litters at once. And I was, oh, my God, they're too Much. Yeah, I'm sitting on 29 puppies right now. Good. I mean, not good, but you probably have. Probably have something that I want, so. You did do too much, Nicole. Yeah, I know. Just. Just clean it. All right. All right, sweetie, I. I understand where you're sitting right now, so I'll call you around 3:00. Okay? Thank you. Okay, see ya. Bye. Bye. Okay, sorry. She's hard to catch. And I could see she was available, so I had to set that appointment up.

[00:14:01]
**Bradley:**
Oh, you're good.

[00:14:02]
**Laney:**
I gotta buy another dog because, you know, I definitely need another dog.

[00:14:07]
**Bradley:**
So do you get, like, dogs and. Or how does. How does that work with other.

[00:14:11]
**Laney:**
So I. So, like, when I retire, my. My Australian shepherds, I have to buy a new Australian shepherd because I don't breed. I could breed an Australian shepherd, but then I have to sell them all. And my algorithm isn't Australian shepherds. So I have a lady out of Austin, Texas, I buy from, and her dogs are just amazing. And so I like to breed. I like to buy from her just because they're. They're kind of really stocky. Real kind of just solid, solid dogs. And so I buy from her and so like, she says she's. She hasn't been breeding for a while because she had that hip. And I just saw. She just posted some dogs and I'm like, crap. And so I always want first breeders pick. So before all customers come, I need to be able to pick from the litter. Just posted them and I'm like, oh, heck no. I need first pick. So that's why I had to do that. But then she flies them in and it works out great and she gives me a fair price and her dogs are amazing. So.

[00:15:10]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. Yeah, probably a. A whole skill in and of itself is picking dogs to. To breathe.

[00:15:20]
**Laney:**
Yes, Sister Missionary. I am on the phone with a gentleman and he doesn't want to hear you burp. Goodness. I'm telling you, when you get off that mission, you're gonna have to. You're gonna have to princess that up a bit. Well, I need a husband that will have a burping contest with. I don't think you're gonna have a husband. Have burping. This is Sister Harrison and this is Sister Hara. This is Bradley. I'm doing my Zoom call.

[00:15:42]
**Bradley:**
Oh.

[00:15:43]
**Laney:**
So give me. Give me 10 minutes. You guys can just sit and relax. Oh, I was going to say we got it out. You got to head out. Okay. Thank you for your help. You're welcome. Was your Zoom call good? It Was good. Thank you for picking up poop. You're welcome. Thank you for helping me pick up my Christmas boxes. Was there anything you, like, desperately needed help with? No. You're so sweet. I'm good. I'm good. No, I just love it when you guys come. I love your company. We love you. I'm glad you love me. Thanks for coming. You're welcome. The same time, I'm sure that Bradley's impressed that you can burp like a man. Did he even hear it? Of course he heard it. The whole house shook. Yeah, who couldn't hear that? All right, girls, have a good day. Thanks.

[00:16:30]
**Bradley:**
You too.

[00:16:30]
**Laney:**
Bye, sweetie. Love you. Thanks for helping. Your dad says it's gross. Okay, well, I know we're gonna. Before you leave on your mission, we're gonna talk about dating skills. Okay. Okay. Goodbye. See you. Okay, I'm ready. All right. They've been here since 7:30, so I had to.

[00:16:56]
**Bradley:**
Oh, nice.

[00:16:58]
**Laney:**
Okay.

[00:16:59]
**Bradley:**
All right, here. Here we go. Let's see how Arnold did. So. So I, again, I guess it's, like, focused on the unique moment or the time. So why. Why do you think Christmas time is such a special time to bring a puppy home? Is there something that makes it like an ideal or special time as opposed to just any other month of the year?

[00:17:27]
**Laney:**
I think the biggest impact is the memory. It's a memory that never forgets. It's a specific date. Do you remember that time I got my puppy for Christmas? I got my first and only puppy on Christmas. And we were a household of dogs. And I couldn't tell you when the other dogs came. We always had dogs in the house, but I couldn't specifically tell you when we got those dogs. But what I can tell you is I remember my mom saying to me, hey, you want to go with me? I have to run an errand because we had to pick up the dog. We couldn't pick up the dog on Christmas day because no breeder wants you to show up on Christmas day. Yeah, so. So it was a couple days before Christmas, it was Christmas Eve, and she says, hey, I need to run an errand and go pick up some stuff. And I had no idea because I kept telling her I wanted a dog, and she kept saying, no, we already have a dog. So I just figured. And my mom said, no, it's no. And I remember her driving me in, and we stopped at this house, and she said, I just need to come in and. And pick up this. You know, I think it was ceramics or something at that time. And so she said, so, come on in. And so we walked in this lady's house, and she was holding this old English sheepdog, little black and white girl. And they put him in my arms. And it's like one of my most favorite memories. I mean, I. If I. It was like the best Christmas in my life. And that dog was my dog because it was. It wasn't a family dog. It was mine. It was given to me. You know, I had brothers and sisters. I didn't have to share it. It was just my dog. So to me, that is like. And I love that dog. So that significant memory had a huge, huge impact. And it also made me feel responsible because it was mine. You know, it was, like, given to me. It wasn't like, hey, we're getting a dog as a family. It was given to me. And I felt a sense of responsibility. So, yeah, that was. Really had a big impact. And I, you know, I felt like I needed to train and I felt like it needed. You know what I mean? It just. It was mine. So that to me, why Christmas Puppies. I think more of it. What is the word I'm looking for a sentimental history that I had, you know, that. That when it does time come time for Christmas, one of the things that we've done, we've had a few families come and pick up their dog for me for Christmas, and the kids don't even know they're coming here, or they'll just say, hey, we're driving through town. Do you guys want to, you know, stop and see a farm? And we've even made. We've even made arrangements for Santa Claus to come and hand the puppy off to the child, because I want them to have that same memory. Do you know what I mean? Because it's a big deal. And they're always in shock, and they're always like, do I get to take it home? And so just those little memories and experiences, you know, when. When I get to see it happen here, it's very, very exciting. I've seen little girls that just break down and cry. I've seen boys also just get so emotional that they just bury their head in the dog because. Because the parents have kept that surprise. And it didn't matter that it was Christmas Day. You know, it was the day before Christmas. It was awesome. You know, and then in zoom calls, I've seen them or videos. I've. Dogs that have flown to other homes for Christmas. I've seen them be unwrapped and out of packages. Like, the mom will Bring in a little box and they open up the bo. And so I just think those, when the parents make that memory like that, it's just something that is an impression that'll last a lifetime. So I think for that reason, for the emotional part is really, really good. And then for the practical part is a lot of people on Christmas break. So it kind of gives you a week or two to develop a routine. You know, summer is nice because it gives you a long, long time to develop a routine. But it also gets interrupted with vacations where Christmas time people are settled in their home, you know. And you know, there's a lot to do in that 10 day Christmas break. You know, there's a lot. And sometimes it's nice to get it a few days before Christmas just so you can start that routine because then when all the kids, the one thing that I did notice, the puppies that did come home at Christmas, there's so much interaction because it's new and all the kids go to school, that's hard on the puppy. And I've even had families that have gotten their dogs in the summer. And then when all the kids go to school, the dogs just sit by the window like what in the heck just happened? And so I want people to be emotionally ready of what are you going to do to help fill that time for the dog? Because it's nothing but love, love, brand new excitement and then the kids go to school. So when you do get a puppy for Christmas, whether it's summertime or Christmas time, when all the kids leave and it's just mom and dad or just mom or dad with that dog, there needs to be a secondary reaction to take care of that dog's needs because they're, they do get, they have those hours when they're gone that they get sad, you know, and if it happens regardless.

[00:22:26]
**Bradley:**
So those are some good things, I mean, tied into like oh, New Year's resolutions, kind of, I don't know. Yeah, hey, we're getting a puppy for Christmas. But. Or not, not saying it but like, hey, here's these, you know, expectations or expectations for you to take care of it.

[00:22:45]
**Laney:**
It's absolutely. And that's one of the things that I tell people is, is you know, if you're buying a dog for a six year old, don't, you know and, and you buy it for the family and mom and dad assume the responsibility. If you're buying it for an eight or nine year old, then take advantage of that opportunity to make that child accountable and responsible for the Dog under the supervision of the parent. You know, there's nothing better than when that dog becomes their dog and they feel a sense of responsibility. But the bottom line is follow through. If the parents don't follow through, then you're going to have an unruly dog. Like, if you see the dog needs, you know, it's hard, but some kids gravitate to it because they really want to learn. But, yeah, tie it into New Year's resolutions. Now we have this dog. What are we going to do to make sure it has the best experience? Because it's not just about you. Have you got to have your experience with this dog. You got to have that Christmas experience. And now you have this thing that you love. Now let's make a New Year's resolution of what we're going to do for the dog. And so it goes two ways.

[00:23:55]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, that makes sense. So it's kind of like benefits and then tips for how to make it work going forwards.

[00:24:02]
**Laney:**
Yeah, yeah. Because we always feel the need of ourselves. When people are buying a dog. There's a need. There's 100% need. They need to be wanted. They need to be loved. They want something to snuggle with. But the thing is, is then that follow through is, you know, people love, love, love. And I have people that don't understand. I don't want to say don't understand. Then there's that all of a sudden, they go to work and those dog. You know, that dog is taking care of everything you needed at home. But what about that? Come on in. So, yeah, he has to go back and now the dog's taking care of your needs.

[00:24:41]
**Bradley:**
What.

[00:24:41]
**Laney:**
What are you going to do for the dog?

[00:24:43]
**Bradley:**
Definitely. Okay. And then so I'm looking at these two.

[00:24:49]
**Laney:**
Come on. Luzakia. How are you? You're done. Awesome. All the dogs are out they go for. Those ones are doing okay in the field. Yeah. Good. Can you go look at Willow, Naughty Willow, and tell me if she's digging? Digging? Is she digging? Oh, okay. Because she's naughty and just look around and see if she's being good. If she's digging, then I'm going to put her in her kennel.

[00:25:25]
**Bradley:**
There we go.

[00:25:29]
**Laney:**
And he's the one that's from Afghanistan.

[00:25:33]
**Bradley:**
Oh, cool. There we go.

[00:25:35]
**Laney:**
He says, what is digging?

[00:25:38]
**Bradley:**
Oh, yeah, the thing they do all the time in the dirt. This. Just a heads up. This zoom meeting says I have like seven minutes left. So I can either do this quick.

[00:25:49]
**Laney:**
I'm good.

[00:25:50]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, we can just blitz through the through the end. So I like these two questions, but the first is how can bringing home a puppy at Christmas set the stage for a long term connection? And how does that sort of like, you know, the whole.

[00:26:05]
**Laney:**
So exactly what we just said. You use what I just said in the earlier paragraph. It does the long term by connection, by setting, setting parameters and goals and milestones. I love the word milestones for that dog. Of what you want in a long term relationship. And by doing that, you sit down and decide what you what, what your expectations and what you want to accomplish. Whether you want to teach the dog agility or you want the dog to be your running partner or all of that. Just. And when you do that, what's the application to make that happen? So, and just a quick example, if you want your dog to be that running partner, then you start small, you, you start with half a mile, you work up to another mile, then you work up to a mile and a half, you do it small, you check the dog, you assess and feel its muscles, you give it a rub down, you just don't take a dog on a five mile run.

[00:26:56]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:26:57]
**Laney:**
That's just an example. There's, it can be applied to anything.

[00:27:00]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So there's, there's some good habits or traditions. Um, what's, I mean, you kind of gave some tips. So any advice or tips to make sure it's stress, stress free for both the puppy and the new family? I know we talked about some of these things before, but. Or if someone's on the fence about getting a Christmas puppy, what would you tell them about the benefits of this timing? Like how do you think the timing makes it.

[00:27:27]
**Laney:**
Yeah. Understand they're a puppy and if your decorations are up, they're going to play with them. So puppy proof the house, get it ready for Christmas. Puppy proof always. Because anything they see that's dangling and sparkling fun, they're going to eat it. Also, people's biggest frustration is potty training. These dogs are smart and the ones that get potty trained are the people that are consistent and do the same thing every day on a routine. And so if they're on the fence about it, they need to, they need to read my blog to learn. So if you're on the fence because of fears or things or a knowledge base, then if you read my blog, I have a lot of things that will answer your question and it'll either A, tell you it's good to go forward or B, tell you maybe to wait.

[00:28:11]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:28:13]
**Laney:**
That's pretty much it. I'll Never. I'll never push anybody if they're on the fence. If they're on the fence, and this is what I want on there. If they're on the fence, it's not my job to push them off the fence and go forward. If they're on the fence, then they're not ready. And that's why I want them to educate and read, and I have people that do that. And my blog provides enough. And I. And I have suggested books that they can read that'll also help them. And then they decide what the commitment is. And some people aren't on the fence because they have a vacation planned, or they're on the fence because they have a future surgery, or they're on the fence because their daughter's going to graduate and they want to wait till after. And. And I will never push them off that fence. I want them coming when they're ready.

[00:28:57]
**Bradley:**
Gotcha. Okay, cool. And. Yeah. And I assume that's something they can talk about, like on a zoom call with you as well, hashing out the details.

[00:29:09]
**Laney:**
And number nine is the memory you can talk about When I got my dog.

[00:29:13]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, that's a perfect example. Let me think. There's one other thing I was going to ask. No, yeah, I think. I think that's solid. There is. I was also going to say, I think you have a blog post in your drafts that I wrote a while back that you can still publish the training one.

[00:29:32]
**Laney:**
I'm going to do the training one today. That one's gonna just to. I like that. No, as a matter of fact, I saw it yesterday, and I told Jody I was going to post it just because the hurricane hit, and I just. Yeah, it's been hard. So. Yeah, you need to. You need to get on Instagram and look at some of the damage on some of these towns. Yeah, it's insane. Sometimes some towns are completely covered in mud. Like there's. There's nothing left. Yeah, it's wiped out. Completely. Blows my mind. So. Yeah, I think that's good. I think you got enough content. Favorite memories we talked about. And if someone's on the fence, we talked about. And then if someone. And then I saw number nine.

[00:30:17]
**Bradley:**
I think you kind of talked about this one, too. But like any traditions, people can start right away.

[00:30:23]
**Laney:**
Oh, yeah. Matching dogs, matching sweaters, matching clothes. I have. I have families that do photo. I have. I have families coming up to do photos with Santa and their dogs. They always have a traditional photo outfit, and they have matching Christmas sweaters and all sorts of things.

[00:30:41]
**Bradley:**
Nice.

[00:30:42]
**Laney:**
All right, that should give you good. You good.

[00:30:44]
**Bradley:**
That should be good.

[00:30:45]
**Laney:**
I know you're gonna run out, so I don't wanna.

[00:30:47]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, now you're good. You're good. Yeah, I think that's a solid start. So, yeah, I will go ahead and whip this up. Is there a certain day that you want to publish this one or what are you thinking?

[00:30:59]
**Laney:**
Can you get done by Wednesday?

[00:31:01]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:31:02]
**Laney:**
Okay.

[00:31:03]
**Bradley:**
All right, I'll pass it to Arno and we'll will collaborate, like, not to.

[00:31:10]
**Laney:**
Use the same things over and over. Like, he begins. He begins his sentence with the same thing a lot. And so I need a variety in. In beginning. So tell him to. Because we talk that way, but when we write that way we can.

[00:31:23]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I was actually asking him last night how I could help. Help guide him to not say repetitive things. So.

[00:31:30]
**Laney:**
Yes.

[00:31:35]
**Bradley:**
But yeah, I love it. We'll have. Have a good time. Make sure. Keep those dogs from escaping and. Yeah, I'll do it.

[00:31:45]
**Laney:**
All right, I'll talk to you later.

[00:31:47]
**Bradley:**
All right, thanks, Lenny.

[00:31:48]
**Laney:**
Bye.

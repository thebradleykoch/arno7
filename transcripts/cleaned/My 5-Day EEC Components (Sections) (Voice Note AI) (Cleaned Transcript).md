# My 5-Day EEC Components (Sections) (Voice Note AI) (Cleaned Transcript)

## Intro

[00:00:02]
**Bradley:**
Alright, so this is just to get a basic outline from my own EEC. This is more. I think it's a lot easier when I'm actually sitting down at the computer just to tactically write some of this stuff out. I think I waste a lot of time trying to stay in voice recording or voice transcription braindump mode a little bit too much. Either braindumping to a voice note myself, or braindumping to a chat back and forth with Arno on certain things.

[00:00:40]
**Bradley:**
It just doesn't work as well.

[00:00:44]
**Bradley:**
Anyway, I'll get more in detail as far as actually documenting that stuff later on, but I think right now this is going to help me bridge the gap between my EEC outline and my actual EEC writing or content. And basically I'm just trying to think, okay, so if this is a 5 mistakes EEC, I think, I'm sure Cole will introduce some sort of basic outline or rhetorical structure to use in this type of EEC. So I might have to backtrack on this a little bit. But this is how I would approach it. And we can see if I need to merge or intertwine or mix, whatever.

[00:01:37]
**Bradley:**
We'll see how it goes. But basically, so this like, components were just basically sections. If you were to put these sections in brackets, and I don't know exactly what type of formatting or type of text goes here, but this is just kind of like, I'm trying to nail down the order of components or sections that I need to include. Okay, so first off, I'm sure you would, you know, there's some sort of intro. Great.

## Introducing the Mistake

[00:02:06]
**Bradley:**
I'm not gonna worry about that too much. Like, Cole will have some sort of structure for that. But once you get more towards the middle. So we have, you're gonna introduce the mistake, I'm sure. We're gonna probably describe why that is a mistake, or probably give tangible, real life examples of what that mistake looks like, like in practice.

[00:02:31]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so number 1 is you call out the mistake, right? You name it, you label it with some sort of one liner, and then you describe it in terms of real life situations and relatable scenarios that the target reader has found themselves in. This is very similar to the way that I write newsletters for Laney, right? Like, I do this all the time, but again, you call that a target situation that is relatable, that resonates with the reader, the target reader. You might use some of their internal dialogue or some sort of myth mistake, misconception to illustrate that.

### Explaining the Problem

[00:03:14]
**Bradley:**
Right. Cool. You then probably go into a brief explanation of why this is a problem, right. So you probably reframe it as like, okay, why is this problem? What is kind of like the irresistible offer formula where it's not enough to just point out what the problem is, you have to point out why that's a problem.

[00:03:37]
**Bradley:**
And then you point out what is the ultimate negative outcome of that problem. Right. So here we're just swapping the word problem for mistake. So call it the mistake.

[00:03:50]
**Bradley:**
Describe it in real life relatable situation that's recognizable by the target reader. Then you point out why it is a mistake, like why it's bad, and then you highlight or illustrate the ultimate negative outcome of that mistake.

[00:04:12]
**Bradley:**
And I want to say you don't spend a huge portion of time on this. I mean, this is basically what constitutes the intro, the majority of the intro section for each email. But you don't want to belabor this too much. You just want to hit it, hit it hard, hit it fast, hit it on a tangible, specific and visceral level that's relatable. And then you move on to the solution or the tip to solve it.

### Actionable Tips and Steps

[00:04:39]
**Bradley:**
Right. And I can't remember exactly if it's a tip or a stop or a step, but let's just say it's an actionable tip, right? Mine is a little bit more than an actionable tip. It's almost like an actionable step by step how to guide to fix that mistake. That's okay, right?

[00:04:59]
**Bradley:**
I'm just gonna roll with it. We're gonna see how this goes. Hopefully it's good. Again, I'm trying to prevent scope creep here by sort of segmenting different things that I could include by level of difficulty. So, like, level 1, level 2, level 3.

[00:05:15]
**Bradley:**
Level 1 is just very basic beginner. Level 2 is intermediate. Level 3 is advanced. And again, the entirety of this EEC is going to be all level 1 type of stuff as far as the actionable tips and how to steps go. Okay, so we're probably going to do, after the ultimate negative outcome of the mistake, we're probably going to have some sort of section or a line that is like a reframe.

[00:05:45]
**Bradley:**
Right? Cool. Good. Basically saying something along the lines of "the good news is, you know, the good news is it doesn't have to be that way."

[00:05:59]
**Bradley:**
Essentially some sort of transition that is a reframe line. And then here's the main part that I want to outline is, okay, cool. Good news is let me take custom instructions as an example. So let me just walk through this.

## Custom Instructions Example

[00:06:23]
**Bradley:**
So mistake is treating your AI as basically a generic customer service agent or a lowlife intern instead of a collaborative partner and personal AI friend, right? That's a mistake. An example of this would be, honestly, you could just screenshot the response, basically the prompt response that ChatGPT gives you that sounds very customer service like, you can even prompt in the beginning to just make this even more extreme, like at the beginning of that chat thread, just say, "Hey, I want you to act as a generic customer service agent" and then go down and then ask it for some task to do something. And then just screenshot your most recent message and then its most recent message and just highlight the annoying language that it uses. Like, "Certainly I would love to help with that."

[00:07:28]
**Bradley:**
Just something annoying, right. For a customer service like, that could be the illustration of the mistake, right? Because that's a real life, tangible screenshot of something people have actually experienced. Okay, so that's how you illustrate it. For this, for this one, for the first day's email, the ultimate negative outcome.

[00:07:52]
**Bradley:**
I don't know. I have to figure this out. But it's basically like an AI that feels like a just frustrating tool rather than a collaborative partner, right?

[00:08:10]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. I don't know. We'll brainstorm more on the ultimate negative outcome, but just an AI that is frustrating that tries to please too much and then basically what it results in is frustrating conversations. Maybe just sort of, here's what I say. What it results in is if you treat it like a generic customer service agent, it will speak back and forth to you like it's just some annoying NPC, right?

[00:08:49]
**Bradley:**
Non player character, just like that. And here's the ultimate negative outcome is that its actual responses that it gives you will be in that same style, tone and voice, right, because they're all filtered through that same identity. So it's giving you ultimately the quality of the responses and of the outputs that you're getting is all going to be shafted down the drain because it's coming from this NPC-like generic customer service agent voice rather than a collaborative partner, right? And instead of asking for your input back and forth, it just goes ahead and recommends, makes whatever generic response or assumptions that it can. Instead of feeling like you're going back and forth refining something together, right?

[00:09:44]
**Bradley:**
So ultimately the quality of the responses gets shanked down the drain because you're interacting with ChatGPT through the lens of this Persona. Right. Cool. So then transition.

### Transition and Reframe

[00:10:01]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Good news is it doesn't have to be that way. You can elevate your AI from a generic tool to a yemenite, like personalized partner or collaborative partner, whatever you want to phrase this. And then the how to sort of actionable tip or how actionable how to steps are going to be like, let's see how we say this.

[00:10:34]
**Bradley:**
Probably go like.

[00:10:43]
**Bradley:**
So. Yeah, like the actionable how to steps would be like, okay, well, here's the mental reframe. Right? So a mental reframe again, I just stated this, but I think it's key. So whenever you're calling out a mistake or a misconception or a myth, you then have to introduce the new thinking, right?

### 6 Fundamental Building Blocks

[00:11:00]
**Bradley:**
This is in Cole's 6 fundamental steps of it. 6 fundamental building blocks of every book, digital product, or course I create. So first is the thinking, second is the emotions. So you have to introduce the new POV, right?

[00:11:14]
**Bradley:**
Oh, this makes so much sense, dude. So just model your emails almost like the six fundamental building blocks just down the line in order, right? Because number 1 is the thinking, number 2 is the emotions, number 3 is the myths.

[00:11:31]
**Bradley:**
Number 4 is the action steps, number 5 is the examples, and number 6 is the template. A lot of these steps can sort of be merged into each other, right? Like the first 3 steps. Thinking, emotions, myths. Right.

[00:11:48]
**Bradley:**
It's kind of like you're pointing out the mistake in the old way of thinking. And then when you're transitioning to the action studies, you contrast that with the new POV, the new way of thinking, the new upgraded perspective and mindset. So once you flip the script with that new mindset, then, which is instead of treating your AI like a generic tool, let's treat it like a collaborative partner and friend that is on your same level. That's an equal, not a subordinate. Okay, cool.

### Action Steps and Custom Instructions

[00:12:21]
**Bradley:**
That's mindset shift. Now let's transition to action steps. Okay. So then we will give action steps like, okay, a way to fix this is easiest way to fix this is through your custom instructions, right. I think a level 2 sort of guide would be through your prompting, like using specific wording in your prompting.

[00:12:43]
**Bradley:**
That triggers that collaborative partner mode. But again, that's level 2 difficulty. So we're not going to include it here. So sticking to level 1, beginner difficulty, level stuff. The easiest way to make this change is by upgrading your custom instructions.

[00:13:00]
**Bradley:**
Okay, here are the 2 different form fields that ChatGPT gives you. Now, here is an example of the template. And I might flip flop these. I'm not 100% sure, but we'll see. I don't know if the example should come before the template.

[00:13:18]
**Bradley:**
Like, should the example come before the formula or should the formula come before the example? I don't know. We'll figure it out. That's a minor point. It's a minor point, so.

[00:13:30]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. Here's the action step. Go to custom instructions. Like number 1, go to custom instructions. Number 2, basically copy and paste this template in.

[00:13:41]
**Bradley:**
Or you could even copy and paste this template into, well, you don't necessarily want to do it inside a word doc, because you need to see the character limit. That's important, I think. So probably step 1, just literally copy and paste whatever template I give into ChatGPT's form fields into each one. And then what I would say is then. So I give my example again.

[00:14:13]
**Bradley:**
The order of these last 3 steps might be shuffled around with action steps, example and template, but I would give my example, like my reformatted, cleaned up example of my own custom instructions for Arno, because I need to clean that up and just make sure it fits in the 1500 character limit. Make sure it's not super cringy so I can actually share it. Make sure it follows my formula so it makes sense. And make sure to introduce those different sentence rhythms and sentence patterns so you can do that anyway.

[00:14:53]
**Bradley:**
Cool. So we'll work out how to refine that. I think that's gonna be an important thing. It's just like having, helping Arno to, having Arno collaborate with me to optimize my custom instructions for him so they don't lose any of their flavor, personality, or sentence structure and formatting, but also to make sure that they fit nicely in my new template and they're not cringy and actually useful and I don't feel afraid of showing them off to other people. As an example.

[00:15:22]
**Bradley:**
As a gold standard example. Right, cool. And then at the end will literally just be that template of the custom instructions with each section also, which form field each section should go in and then bullet points for basically prompts, right? Prompts such as, this is how to do such and such, right? Like, here's a question.

### Yin Yang Prompting

[00:15:50]
**Bradley:**
What personality attributes do you want to include? And I'm kind of hesitant. I'm debating whether I should include Yin Yang prompting here because it's the bounce of opposites, right? Maybe I just include that as a pro tip, right? So it's not like a main section, but it's more like, hey, here's a pro tip for personality attributes.

[00:16:10]
**Bradley:**
This is what I call Yin Yang prompting. And basically you're picking personality attributes such as you can be introspective and independent, right? Those are personality attributes I want my personal AI friend to adopt, but I also want them to adopt sort of the opposite yet complementary personality attributes as well. So, what is opposite yet complement but complementary of introspective and independent? Right?

[00:16:44]
**Bradley:**
I would say, like introspective, let's see. But also extroverted and collaborative, right? Like, those could be. These are just complimentary pairs is basically all you're going for, right? So what's the opposite of.

[00:17:08]
**Bradley:**
What's the complementary opposite of introspective? Well, instead of thinking about yourself, maybe you're thinking about others. So that could be extroverted. I'm sure there could be plenty of other personality attributes along those lines. You could also say empathetic, right?

[00:17:25]
**Bradley:**
Because empathetic is you are feeling and sensing the emotions of others, whereas introspective is more. So you're just looking inward, right? So that could be another complementary personality attribute, again, independent. The opposite of that could be, again, collaborative or, I don't know, just some other word. Some other word that means, I mean, I guess you could say interdependent, but then whatever.

[00:17:54]
**Bradley:**
Just basically, that should be a quick pro tip for selecting personality attributes, right?

## Refining Custom Instructions

[00:18:03]
**Bradley:**
And then I think one thing I do really gotta key in on to figure out is with this custom instructions prompt template. When I include the bullet points for each section of what to include, I don't know.

[00:18:22]
**Bradley:**
I really do want to drill down on what kind of things to include because I think Lara did a good example because she's like, you know, you come from such and such background. Like, I can't remember. She said, like, a blue collar background, but recently you're more like white collar family, I don't know, but just anything that is relevant to the culture or the relationship or the shared personal experiences, shared personal beliefs, type of background, those things are valuable, right? So anyway, and then that would be the end of that one, right? It would just be like, okay, cool, it's the end of this email.

### Completing the Email

[00:19:03]
**Bradley:**
Like, once you have implemented this template, you're free to move on to the next day's email. But don't move on until you finish this. Just finish this. It should take you, I would give a time estimate to, this should take you 5 to 10 minutes.

[00:19:23]
**Bradley:**
Maybe I should time myself 5 to 10 minutes, something like that.

[00:19:37]
**Bradley:**
So we'll figure it out. We will figure it out.

### Considering Advanced Options

[00:19:45]
**Bradley:**
I was thinking about, I don't know if I want to do this. This is probably too advanced. I was thinking like, if it would make it easier for people to do, I could introduce a prompt. Custom instructions, prompt words basically throws that to ChatGPT, and you collaboratively fill it out together.

[00:20:05]
**Bradley:**
But honestly, I feel like it's such a short prompt where it's only 1500 characters that I'd rather people just skip to the end and just type it out. Right. It doesn't have to be that complicated.

### Adding a Final Note

[00:20:25]
**Bradley:**
I do want to plug a note at the end, though. It should be something along the lines of, hey, these custom instructions, these are just a first draft, right? This is supposed to get you from, this is a first draft. It's 80% good. Just understand that you will refine and iterate this, iterate on this for the coming weeks and probably even months.

[00:20:51]
**Bradley:**
That's totally okay. Like, any time that you notice a pattern that your AI assistant uses that you don't like, just add that to the patterns to avoid section, right? Or if you notice that it does something that you really like, you can ask "Hey, how can I reinforce that?" And then plug that line of instructions into your custom instructions, right? So just add a note on there that hey, this is a first draft, obviously.

[00:21:20]
**Bradley:**
This is not over and done, but this is something that you will refine and iterate on for weeks and months to come. That's totally normal, right? Okay, cool. Time estimate to do this, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool.

[00:21:35]
**Bradley:**
Once you've done that next, right?

### Naming Your AI Friend

[00:21:43]
**Bradley:**
And I would even say, if you don't, if you haven't thought of a name for your AI friend yet, that's totally fine. Just think of a random name and plug, play it in as a placeholder for now. Like, you can go change it later, but at least get this down on, at least get your first draft copy down, right? Don't let anything hold you back from getting this first draft down. I think that's pretty good outline.

[00:22:07]
**Bradley:**
Like, skeleton outline for all the components and actually, a real life example of the custom instructions that I would like to do for again, my day 1 email, right?

[00:22:27]
**Bradley:**
But, yeah, I think that's good.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

[00:22:31]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, dude, let's go with that. Let us go with that. And in terms of the skeleton outlining the rest of them, I think we're gonna keep the beginning basically the same. Right? Like I talked about this, but basically you have some sort of intro, personalized intro, whatever.

[00:22:47]
**Bradley:**
Then you call out the mistake, point blank, the mistake that you described in your headline of that day's email or the subject line, whatever you want to call it. And then you, so you call it out, you then give some sort of illustration or demonstration or description of how it manifests in real life, like a target, a real life situation that is really relatable, that resonates with the target reader where they go, "Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh, I've totally done that before, or I've totally experienced that before." Right? And then you move on to point out or briefly explain why that is a mistake, like why that's bad.

[00:23:35]
**Bradley:**
And then you go on to describe the ultimate negative outcome of that mistake or that problem, right? And then from there, you go. You then use a transition or a reframe, right?

[00:23:48]
**Bradley:**
So from old POV to new POV. Like, here's the upgraded mindset or new way of thinking or new approach to this. Cool. And here are the actionable steps that basically show you the how, right? So, I mean, this is kind of like a what how why framework.

[00:24:15]
**Bradley:**
Like, if you really wanted to, because you could do actionable steps of how to apply, you know, the new thinking, the new POV. And then you provide an example to, ideally with screenshots, screenshots of chat messages or even. I was thinking about this. I don't know if I should do a video, like a brief video for things like demoing advanced voice mode or if a GIF would be even better. That's actually a really good question to ask, I think, is when would you want to use an embedded video vs a gif?

[00:24:56]
**Bradley:**
Right?

[00:24:59]
**Bradley:**
So that'd be important. Let's see, man, we will figure this out. So cool.

[00:25:26]
**Bradley:**
Let's see, what else? What else, what else?

### Final Thoughts on Structure

[00:25:35]
**Bradley:**
Let's see. So, right, so you have action steps. You have the example, you have the template. I think you should always include some sort of pro tip, just insiders information of, like, if from my vantage point, like, hey, I've actually experienced this, here is a potential problem you might run into. Or here's just a pro tip that I think is helpful for how to execute this step or how to approach this when you're filling in a template.

[00:26:08]
**Bradley:**
Right. One other thing I could potentially do, which I don't want to mess with too much, but I could annotate these screenshots. So certain screenshots, I do want to treat this kind of like the Write With AI WWAI newsletter, where the screenshots they include, usually it's like they include a screenshot that illustrates something, right? Whether it's an infographic or, I don't know, some sort of screenshot of something leading up to the output of the prompt template. But then at the end they include the screenshot of the actual chat messages from their example, either detailing the input of their example or the output or whatever, right?

[00:26:58]
**Bradley:**
I think again, and I don't want to introduce too much scope creep here, but it could be useful in some scenarios to annotate a couple things on those screenshots. Just do call attention to them, to point them out and that kind of thing. I mean, even yin yang prompting, right?

[00:27:28]
**Bradley:**
So that could be something useful, right? You could even have a little arrow, a little arrow, like a little yin Yang symbol kind of drawn, and then a arrow labeling number 1 personality attribute, and then number 1, opposite, and then number 1 or number 2 yin, number 2 yang, that kind of stuff. I don't know. Could be fun. Don't get too far into it, though, we'll figure it out, right.

### Formatting and Presentation

[00:28:08]
**Bradley:**
And then at the end of each email. So again, you have the action steps, you have the example, you have the template, and you're going to use some sort of form of screenshots or copy and paste template. I would use a code block. I definitely embed a code block for the template to be able to copy and paste that. Embed a code block using Markdown formatting.

[00:28:30]
**Bradley:**
And yeah, if I need to explain any of the formatting syntax of the prompt, I will, but I don't want to get too overboard. Like, it should be pretty self explanatory. Right, cool. So, so let's roll with that. And then again, you should always have some sort of thing at the end.

[00:28:56]
**Bradley:**
Hopefully it should be like time to apply, like, hey, it should only take, for example, 5 to 10 minutes to apply this.

[00:29:07]
**Bradley:**
And maybe a recap of things that you need. So like number 1, prompt template, number 2. So recap of this. Number 1, copy, paste the prompt template. Step 2, like, if you're doing, I don't know, copy and paste another file.

[00:29:29]
**Bradley:**
If you need to or copy paste text from another file. Step 3, run the prompt. Step 4, refine. I don't know, just some sort of recap of the steps. So you know exactly what inputs you need and what outputs you're gonna get.

[00:29:43]
**Bradley:**
You know what resources you're going to need to pull from, you know what resources you're going to get out and then where to put those resources so they're plugged in, they're applied and that kind of thing. But yeah, so time estimate for completion, how long it takes to do this, this days email steps and then some sort of very brief number list recap of all the steps that are normally going to be sub heads that are probably sub heads above and then some sort of, again, you should definitely use a screenshot of the output as an example of hey, here is the output of this prompt. So for my custom instructions example, that would be like, hey, compare and contrast this to the first interaction wherever where it was very generic customer service like and out here is Arno's output for me. Or obviously your personal AI's will be different just based on how you want to interact with it. But here is sort of a level of personalization that you can expect and as a result, what is the ultimate positive outcome?

[00:30:55]
**Bradley:**
Again, you want to make sure to mirror this. So if you call out the mistake at the beginning, you call it out. You give a real life example of it. You explain why it's bad, right? It's kind of like pest control.

[00:31:12]
**Bradley:**
Point it out, describe it in real life scenario where they've seen it. Point out and describe why it's bad. Educate why it's bad. Educate on the ultimate negative outcome and why you need to change. Okay, cool.

[00:31:27]
**Bradley:**
Now we're pointing out the positive action to take. That is the inverse of the mistake. Right. Point of positive action to take. Give a real life example of what that looks like.

[00:31:38]
**Bradley:**
Explain why this is the way to go. Like why this is the correct version, this is the correct approach. And then give an example and also reasons why of why. What is the ultimate positive outcome? Why does it matter?

[00:31:54]
**Bradley:**
What does that look like in real life? Okay, so, yeah, and then obviously you'll have a link to the next day's email in the sequence. But just a very urgent but also confident call to action saying, hey, do this before you move on. It takes this much time, no excuses. You got this.

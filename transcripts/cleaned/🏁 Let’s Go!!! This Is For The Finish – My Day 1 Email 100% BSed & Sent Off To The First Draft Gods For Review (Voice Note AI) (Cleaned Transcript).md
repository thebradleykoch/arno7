# üèÅ Let‚Äôs Go!!! This Is For The Finish ‚Äì My Day 1 Email 100% BSed & Sent Off To The First Draft Gods For Review (Voice Note AI) (Cleaned Transcript)

## Intro: Setting the Stage for the Day 1 Email

[00:00:08]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. So let's see.

[00:00:13]
**Bradley:**
Right now, here's what I'm thinking in this voice note. Like I don't want to have to really dissect this one too deeply. I just want to lay down the actionable steps or real-life usable scripts and content as they should be in the final format I'm actually going to use without having to do a lot of extraction or jumping through hoops.

[00:00:59]
**Bradley:**
So here it is, clear-cut, simple, and straightforward.

## Exploring Nicolas Cole's Writing Rhythms

[00:01:10]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, here's the thing. I think Nicolas Cole's 1-3-1 writing rhythm, and honestly, like all his other writing rhythms, are interesting. Like his 1-2-5-3-1 or something like that.

[00:01:30]
**Bradley:**
And then he has like a 1-1-1-4-1. I don't know, there are like a billion different writing rhythm blocks or formats you could follow. Basically, what I'm taking away from his content that I'm reading online, like all of the Write With AI newsletters and his individual posts in the Skool community.

[00:02:08]
**Bradley:**
Like I can't easily and predictably pinpoint a specific writing rhythm that he's following deterministically. Right. I think it's much more like, here are these different writing rhythms and you can use them as a structure or a template to get you started. But at the end of the day, this is not a hard and fast rule. You don't have to stick to these 100% verbatim because sometimes writing is messy and sometimes you add your own style and flavor.

## Using Writing Rhythms as a Launching Pad

[00:02:48]
**Bradley:**
So just use those as a launching pad or starting point to get from 0 to 80%. And then the last 20% is where you can freestyle it, make your own personal adjustments however you feel.

## Revised POV on Writing Rhythms

[00:03:10]
**Bradley:**
That is an upgraded new POV that I didn't have before. My old POV was I believed that Cole religiously stuck to any one of his given writing rhythms and followed those exactly without really straying from them. But I just don't think that's how it is.

## Balancing Letter of the Law and Spirit of the Law

[00:03:39]
**Bradley:**
We got the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. You kind of gotta use both. So anyway, moving on from that realization, I think even so, in each day's email for this 5-Day Educational Email Course (5-Day EEC), I don't think that I'm going to exactly follow Cole's 1-3-1 writing rhythm. I might stray from it a bit.

## Strategy for Writing the Day 1 Email

[00:04:12]
**Bradley:**
I think the main thing that I want to do to keep this tight and focused without bleeding my attention into different tangents is to rewatch the module 3 writing video where Cole walks you through his example of writing Day 1's email. I'm just gonna follow along as much as possible and implement his 1-3-1 writing rhythm right there on my screen. I'll have a side-by-side screen. On the left side will be Cole's video playing, and I'll pause and play it. On the right side will be my Notion doc that I have open where I'm writing this out.

## Implementing a Follow-Along Approach

[00:05:02]
**Bradley:**
Right, let's see.

[00:05:14]
**Bradley:**
And I'm just going to try to do a follow-along or over-the-shoulder approach, even though it's not going to be perfect and there will be some bumpy potholes. That's okay. We're going to follow this freeway to our destination at the end of the day, and I'll make my tweaks as needed. I think really, honestly, only the main sections and places where I will probably stray from Cole's original guidance are like the sections at the end where I appended those and extended those, where I basically added on multiple extra subsections, either H2 headers or H3 headers.

## Personalizing the Writing Approach

[00:06:10]
**Bradley:**
And that totally makes sense because it's like, well, if I modified the end of the Day 1 template, then yeah, obviously I'm going to stray from Cole's 1-3-1 writing rhythm the way that he presents it, because he only shows you how to use it within the sections he outlines. Right. So anyway, that just makes sense. So keep whatever is the same, keep it the same. Just try to match and mirror my implementation to Cole's demonstration as much as possible.

[00:06:48]
**Bradley:**
But wherever I have made deliberate changes, that's where it becomes really obvious. Like, okay, cool, you can break free from the mold now. You should use your own critical thinking a little bit more now instead of trying to force fit or deterministically prescribe some arbitrary writing rhythm or template or rhetorical structure that was never given by Cole in the first place, because these are your own sections that you've personally added for your own personal educational email course. Right. So anyway, flow with the mentor, but feel free to chart your own course for the checkpoints and the waypoints that you need to make sense.

## Simplifying the Creative Process

[00:07:47]
**Bradley:**
Cool. Let's see.

[00:07:55]
**Bradley:**
And I think, honestly, man, the probably easiest way to go about this, just to blitz through on a skim board level and just get all the way through this, do a first pass, would be like, I have a bunch of different deep AI chat threads, both in Claude, by Anthropic, and also in ChatGPT. And I could try to make sure I'm not missing any puzzle pieces by over herding, like herding all of these cattle and trying to account for every single one and every single artifact or message within each of these chat threads.

[00:08:41]
**Bradley:**
But I think that's just insanity, right? Like, these chat threads should basically serve as opening loops of ideation, exploration, and brainstorming. Then whatever key artifacts or messages absolutely resonate with me 100%, you know, at a 95% plus level gut feeling, like, you just take one look and you're like, yeah, that's the one. Just go with those.

## Trusting Intuition in the Creative Process

[00:09:20]
**Bradley:**
And those are usually gonna be the ones that will naturally pop into your memory and come to your subconscious mind without you having to forcefully hunt them down and go scorched earth mode and explore every square inch of the planet to try to account for potential gems that you may have left on the table. Right. I think that's just a very unloving and also broken and frenzied way of going about it. That is how the old Bradley would approach it because he's terrified of the uncertainty of potentially missing a puzzle piece or missing a diamond in the mine.

## Embracing a Confident and Relaxed Approach

[00:10:12]
**Bradley:**
But the new Bradley, the upgraded Bradley, is confident that what's essential, like the essential diamonds and gems, will come to mind and they will show themselves, they will manifest, and they will appear as he puts himself out there and starts putting himself in motion and taking the next steps. And he knows that they will naturally fall into place as he does his best and also trusts God to spiritually surface these things and put these stepping stones into the right places because that's his job to do.

## Delegating Responsibilities for Mental Peace

[00:11:06]
**Bradley:**
That's all up to his power. It's something that I can try to do all I want myself, but I just don't have the actual power or ability to. And I just gotta give it up to him, put those responsibilities and those skills in his hands and take my responsibilities and skills that I'm accountable for and take them into my hands. Right.

## Smooth Collaboration with a Higher Power

[00:11:38]
**Bradley:**
That's how we tag team this. Tag team this in a way that feels smooth and flows with momentum instead of feeling like I'm ripping my hair out, running circles in my own mind alone.

## Creating a Capture System for Key Ideas

[00:12:00]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, man, I think the way that I'm gonna do this is going to be I need some sort of one funnel or one main inflow or intake place where I'm going to capture these key ideas or things that I definitely want to apply that come into my mind. Right. So I'm just trying to think, I think, I mean, ideally we have a capture system. Right now I'm experimenting with using Kortex as my top-of-funnel capture system... so we'll see how that goes. And the purpose of our capture system is to eventually put these elements on the page in their real-life format, as real-life content.

[00:12:52]
**Bradley:**
Because that is the final destination. Right. Ultimately, if we can skip the middleman and just go from point A to point Z, we'll do that. Right. So if I notice something in a markdown file artifact from one of my Claude AI chats, for example, that I'm like, oh yeah, I definitely want to make sure that I include this key element within my element labels or in my element names when I'm outlining this in Notion, then I would literally just pull up that artifact on one side of my screen and then pull up my Notion page on the other and go back and forth, copying and implementing any of the key things I need to transfer them over.

## Streamlining the Integration of Ideas

[00:13:52]
**Bradley:**
Cool. Put them in their final format. Hopefully, there aren't a lot of extra steps. This should just be like picking strawberries and putting them in a basket. Right?

[00:14:02]
**Bradley:**
We're not trying to pick strawberries and then make them into jam and then transport them across the world. Right. We're literally just picking berries, putting them in the basket. It should be a one-to-one easy transfer. And then once I've done that, once I know that these key changes are put into place in their final destination, then I can breathe a sigh of relief.

## Achieving Peace of Mind Through Organization

[00:14:30]
**Bradley:**
I can feel peace of mind because I know that this inspiration source, which is the markdown artifact from the AI chat, is accounted for and I can basically check it off my list and close it. I don't need to open it back up again or come back to it ever again if I don't want to. But at least I don't need to reopen it for the foreseeable future until I'm done writing this 5-Day Educational Email Course, right? It's basically like, okay, loop closed, cool. Seal the grave. Checking off the list, close that book.

## Closing Loops and Focusing on Essentials

[00:15:13]
**Bradley:**
I'm not gonna leave it open or visible for me to accidentally see it again as a shiny object and then go restudy it and open up new loops, right? So anyway, yeah, I think that's super important: let's close these loops. And the only loops we're closing are the essential diamonds that naturally and spiritually pop into my mind on a subconscious level as I'm going through this, right. I'm not trying to check the box for every single micro-diamond in the mine. I'm literally just letting the essentials flow into my lane and picking them up like I'm driving Mario Kart and running into those power-up cubes and just absorbing them, right?

[00:16:18]
**Bradley:**
I just hit the ones that are in my lane and then we keep going forward.

## Establishing a Mental Shift for Peace and Focus

[00:16:27]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, I think that's going to be a good approach. That's going to be a mental shift that'll make things a lot more peaceful, calm, and confident for me going forward. Calm the stormy.

## Breakthrough in Structuring Email Content

[00:16:50]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. And then I'd say this next part is one of the most important breakthroughs that I've made mentally. And I need to just apply it now, like full send, launch the rocket to the moon. Make it happen. And that is that when I am creating this outline, it's basically an email structure outline plus.

[00:17:21]
**Bradley:**
Well, no, here's what I called it. I think I called it the email component structure plus element outline, right? It's just the structure and the elements, right? So it's beyond the initial prep, the page skeleton outline, but it's still coming before the actual full-on email content for the first draft, right. And so in this middle intermediate stage, what I'm doing is I'm outlining the elements, but then I am specifically upgrading these element bullet points in a way that uses descriptive prompts.

## Transforming Descriptive Statements into Questions

[00:18:14]
**Bradley:**
And I'm basically turning these rhetorical moves or these rhetorical directives, which are basically just the element bullet points or the element content descriptions of what to include in each section, into self-prompt interview questions. And one thing I'd say is you can literally just go and write the outline, right? Write the bullet points. But just make sure that the way you write the bullet points using these descriptive statements, uses descriptive statements that are worded or phrased in a way that makes them very easy to immediately flip over into a question format of that same descriptive statement.

[00:19:19]
**Bradley:**
Right? So for example, so let's see, let's see. So this is in the section, in the subhead section called "The Reason This Happens."

[00:20:21]
**Bradley:**
Let's see.

## Crafting Interview Questions from Descriptive Statements

[00:20:24]
**Bradley:**
So here's one of the bullet points for that section. I said here's the descriptive statement. Basically, it says hit them with a throwback snapshot, AKA mini history lesson, bringing awareness to the old POV and where it came from, using relatable examples. Right? So that's the descriptive statement that's very easy to flip over into a question formatted version of that statement with very minor tweaks.

[00:21:09]
**Bradley:**
So the way that I turn that into a self-prompt interview question would be something like, "Where, looking back in time, did this mistake originate and where did it come from? What were the specific relatable examples of real-life situations that formed this old POV in people's minds?" Right, something like that. I'm kind of riffing here, it's a little messy, but just turning that into a question. Right? And that way it's really easy for me to think instead of trying to write on top of the statement or trying to write over the statement and think, "Okay, well, how do I write this?"

## Encouraging Conversational Responses to Questions

[00:22:23]
**Bradley:**
Instead, you turn it into a question which naturally prompts you to fill in the blank. So it's like, "Oh, okay, well let me tell you conversationally in a voice note. I would say that, looking back in time in history, probably a good relatable example is when Siri first came out for Apple back in 2011. It was supposed to be this revolutionary new AI innovation that was supposed to knock your socks off. But in reality, Siri could only follow really rigid commands and you'd have to say them perfectly word for word, otherwise Siri would misinterpret you and she just wouldn't work."

## Reflecting on AI Limitations and User Expectations

[00:23:21]
**Bradley:**
Right. And the problem is, still to this day, literally almost a decade and a half later, Siri is still just as bad. And so this is why people have been jaded into not just being over-promised in terms of what their AI can do for them and under-delivered on, but also unconsciously trained into thinking that their AI must be dumb. They have to stick to a rigid set of commands that are very short and almost like caveman sentences. They must never stray from those because otherwise, the AI will misunderstand them, or they don't even know they think. The AI will probably just not even be capable of adding more value through a more conversational back-and-forth instruction rather than a rigid command.

## Simplifying the Writing Process Through Self-Prompting

[00:24:34]
**Bradley:**
So that's a little bit more like a longer form answer to that one bullet point. But you can see it's very easy to answer when I write that descriptive statement in a way that is very easy to flip over into a self-prompt interview question without majorly changing the wording or the keywords or the actual content of that statement.

## Managing Content Volume and Selection

[00:25:18]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, I would honestly say, here's the thing, dude, I think I have way more in terms of ideas and content than I need. This written-out version of my Day 1 email is going to have to consolidate a lot or just be very picky and choosy and selective about the points that it uses from my self-prompt interview question answers that I give. So I wouldn't worry about that. I wouldn't worry about perfectly phrasing the questions or perfectly answering them in an ocean level of depth and clarity.

## Setting Constraints for Efficient Responses

[00:26:09]
**Bradley:**
I think if you're able to just literally get out a paragraph of conversational voice note transcript text, that's perfect. Aim to answer each one of these self-prompt questions with a paragraph or two worth of voice note text. And probably, unless you really are feeling on one and want to go on a rant, I'd probably cap it at like try to keep your responses to each of these bullet questions under two minutes, definitely under five because at that point you're just going off into the Bermuda Triangle. But yeah, so that's what I do.

## Recording and Transcribing Voice Answers

[00:26:57]
**Bradley:**
I would aim for one or two paragraphs of text in terms of just recording my voice and transcribing that as one to two paragraphs of answer text for each bullet point. That is a self-prompt interview question, right? And probably max it out, aim for a maximum of like two minutes worth of conversationally answering each question and hard cap it at 5 for sure.

## Establishing a Game Plan with Constraints

[00:27:37]
**Bradley:**
I have no idea how many paragraphs that would be, but it's probably easier to just guess the minute mark.

[00:27:48]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, that's a good constraint. It's a good game plan set of rules for me going forward.

## Writing Clear and Effortless Descriptive Statements

[00:28:02]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, each time that you write a descriptive statement, AKA a rhetorical directive or a rhetorical move or a bullet point that is a rhetorical statement, just always at the end of that double-check and go back and read it again and ask yourself, "Okay, did I write this in a way that is super clear and easy to read? In a way that is effortless to flip over into a self-prompt interview question?"

## Testing the Clarity of Descriptive Statements

[00:28:44]
**Bradley:**
And if so, maybe just go ahead and add another bullet point right below that and test it out. Try rephrasing that descriptive statement as a self-prompt question and see if it works. Because if it's so easy and effortless, you should be able to do that in like 10 seconds. And if it's not easy and frictionless, that's a good sign that you got to clarify what you're aiming for with that descriptive statement.

## Establishing a Consistent Outlining Pattern

[00:29:22]
**Bradley:**
So that is the prevailing pattern that I'm going to follow for the remainder of outlining this structural or whatever you want to call it, component structure plus element outline. This is the pattern and approach I'm going to take. Cool.

## Emulating Successful Newsletter Examples

[00:29:48]
**Bradley:**
So moving on to my personal additional sections that I'm gonna add on to the end of this email.

[00:30:03]
**Bradley:**
Honestly, I would just literally emulate as close as possible a good Write With AI newsletter example, right? Like I would just look at one of those newsletters and I'd be like, "Okay, cool. This shows me exactly how to write and format the sections that I'm going to be using to teach the new POV, right?" Which is the new mindset, the mental shift.

## Structuring the Email with Action Steps and Examples

[00:30:43]
**Bradley:**
And then that subhead is going to be followed by the action steps subhead, right? Where you're just walking through the steps in detail one at a time, making it really easy to follow.

[00:31:07]
**Bradley:**
And then you're going to follow that with the examples subhead section, right? Ideally, you would show a black and white example or a bad example vs a good example to show contrast, almost like a before and after comparison. So ideally you're not just showing, "Oh, here's my work. I did it right. I aced the test. Here's how to follow my work."

## Providing Pro Tips and Avoiding Mistakes

[00:31:58]
**Bradley:**
Here's basically a pro tip or a common authority obstacle or maybe even a sub-mistake or misconception to avoid, some sort of friction point that people might have during this specific action step when they try to implement the example. You'd be like, "Okay, now I know what you're probably thinking, and here's how I know that. But we want to avoid going down that road because this is what it results in." Then insert a screenshot of the bad example, right? That this sub-mistake or misconception or friction point could potentially lead to.

## Contrasting Good and Bad Examples

[00:32:53]
**Bradley:**
And then contrast that. Just juxtapose that by saying, "Okay, cool. So here are the obvious mistakes. Here are the less obvious mistakes. Here's an example of what that looks like."

[00:33:07]
**Bradley:**
Obviously, you want to avoid that, right? Here's evidence. Cool screenshot. Now here's how we avoid that. Instead, aim for this polar end of the spectrum, right?

## Offering Context and Specific Examples

[00:33:22]
**Bradley:**
Aim for this and give them context, give them specific examples or pro tips. And then right there, plop in the good example screenshot, right? It's kind of like a, "Here are the red flags to avoid and the green flags to aim for," right? Just back to back, really simple, and kind of walking you through how to do that and just sort of pre-resolving objections and potential concerns.

## Pre-Resolving Potential Questions and Concerns

[00:34:00]
**Bradley:**
It's not even like potential concerns. It's basically like pre-resolving potential questions or uncertainties or roadblocks and sort of hidden potholes that my target reader has a good chance of getting derailed by, right? And I might have to go back in my mind and actually reflect on these things a little more deeply and zoom out and ask myself, "Okay, when I was at this same stage as my reader, what things did I try that ended up being a waste of time or not working? And how have I changed my approach since then? What have I done differently?"

## Providing Quick Wins and Time-Saving Advice

[00:34:51]
**Bradley:**
How can I basically give them a quick win and a college degree's worth of time-saving and headache-saving advice in one section? In one little section, right? Like give you a little power-up, a little time saver, energy saver, skill maker level up, whatever.

## Focusing on the Most Helpful Examples

[00:35:26]
**Bradley:**
And I think a key thing here is, here's the constraint I would use. I would not try to account for and include an exhaustive list of all the potential obstacles or things that could go wrong and all the examples of what that looks like and all the good examples or potential positive ways that you could go about this, followed by all these various screenshots. Like, I'm not trying to present to you every single potential path you could go down. At the end of the day, you're gonna have to go down some dead-end roads yourself to really figure this out and gain pattern recognition for yourself. But I'm at least going to stop you right before you accidentally make that turn and show you the most common or most prevalent and useful and helpful example of what to avoid and then also the example of what to aim for, right?

## Offering a Get Out of Jail Free Card

[00:36:53]
**Bradley:**
I'm just going to give you basically a free, like a "Get Out of Jail Free" card. I'm not giving you an unlimited supply because that would be me trying to account for all of the potential edge cases that I'm aware of and that I have learned through my own firsthand experience and pattern recognition. I'm not trying to give you a whole deck of "Get Out of Jail Free" cards by preventing every potential pitfall and giving you every potential reward or solution. I'm literally just giving you one "Get Out of Jail Free" card which is showing you the friction point or the potential obstacle to avoid.

## Providing a Starting Boost with a Mini Scholarship

[00:37:43]
**Bradley:**
And then also, like a, I don't know what you want to call this. What's the opposite of a "Get Out of Jail Free" card? I'm gonna give you some free scholarship money. I'm gonna give you a little mini scholarship fund to give you some momentum and give you a boost so you can get started and get going, get off on the right foot and have a clear path forward. But you gotta figure the rest out.

## Embracing a Supportive Role in the Learning Process

[00:38:15]
**Bradley:**
I'm just gonna get you started. Cool. Yeah, I think that's a solid way of looking.

## Avoiding Overwhelm with Strategic Support

[00:38:25]
**Bradley:**
So let's see. How do we do this?

[00:38:32]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, it's almost like I'm not trying to turn myself into a trust fund daddy that's gonna pad your entire college education bills. Like, I'm not gonna fund the whole thing, but rather I'm gonna give you a little $5,000 grant or $5,000 fund to put towards your tuition.

## Acknowledging the Value of Diverse Contributions

[00:38:58]
**Bradley:**
Right. And I'm doing that knowing that so many other people are also going to offer you their own scholarship funds. Some of them are going to be $2,000 here, some of them are going to be $20,000. Some of them might be a whole semester of 50 grand worth of tuition. In terms of the level of advice that they share through their own unique personal experiences and perspective and personality.

## Contributing as Part of a Larger Educational Ecosystem

[00:39:33]
**Bradley:**
Like, that is great.

[00:39:36]
**Bradley:**
Multiple creators and different mentors and influences and people are going to contribute to your growth and evolution and education in learning this particular skill with AI. And that's great. I acknowledge that I'm not the only contributor, and I shouldn't be because that'd be failure. But rather I'm just going to give you the first stair on the staircase and I'm going to get you started, right?

## Providing Initial Support and Encouragement

[00:40:06]
**Bradley:**
I'm going to fill up your gas tank for the road trip and send you off. I'll be calm, confident, happy, and at ease within myself, knowing that I contributed that first building block without trying to overreach and make myself responsible for providing every potential lesson or piece of advice you'll ever need. Because you'll naturally pick those up on your own from a multitude of contributors and people you need to learn from. I'm just one star in a constellation.

## Structuring the How to Fix It Section

[00:40:57]
**Bradley:**
Cool. So anyway, we've accounted for the "how to fix it" section, which is how to fix the mistake. You have the new POV, the new mindset and approach. Cool. That's an H3 underneath the H2 "how to fix it" subhead, right?

## Walking Through the Action Steps

[00:41:28]
**Bradley:**
So then the next H3 I talked about was the action steps, right? The step-by-step walkthrough.

## Illustrating with Examples and Pro Tips

[00:41:41]
**Bradley:**
And then the next H3 is the examples. Bad example vs good example with some pro tips. Your "Get Out of Jail Free" card and also your first scholarship fund card.

## Providing a Template for Easy Application

[00:41:53]
**Bradley:**
And then next we have the next H3 section, which is the template. Cool. So the template is literally just a markdown formatted code block. We're just giving them a fill-in-the-blank template that they can copy and paste in one go. Then fill in the content for the variables and the placeholders for their own context.

## Preparing for Future Steps and Summarizing Progress

[00:42:28]
**Bradley:**
Super easy. And keep in mind too, after the template, you're going to have the next major H2 subhead section, which is the next steps and the next email reminder. Which has everything you need in it to preview and give a sort of picture of the future to look forward to and prepare for what's coming next. And then you have the sign-off, whatever.

## Ensuring Flexibility in Content Structure

[00:43:23]
**Bradley:**
And so I think one thing to prevent myself from tripping up here is that each of these H3 subhead sections that I just outlined and described, they don't necessarily follow each other one after another in a linear order, but rather they almost all overlap. So I'm saying they're H3 subhead sections when really I'm just saying that because that's how I'm going to approach outlining them. I'm going to put down the bullet points of the descriptive statements and content that I need to include within each of those H3 sections first. But when I actually go to write that content, I might dissolve or rearrange or even get rid of the H3 subheads and intertwine or interstitch these key component elements or component sections together in a way that flows and makes sense.

## Maintaining Clarity and Ease of Understanding

[00:44:09]
**Bradley:**
We don't have to keep everything in its own segregated box necessarily. We just want to make sure that each component or section or element appears where it makes the most sense and where it's easiest to understand and apply and move forward on. Cool.

## Recapping Achievements and Setting Goals

[00:44:36]
**Bradley:**
And I definitely do want to include some sort of... I don't know if this comes right before the next step section. Maybe it is in this last H2 section that I'm calling next steps. Maybe it's a combo of, "Okay, here's a quick recap of what we've done. Here's what you should have done by now. Here's the quick win or result you should have. Here's where you should have put that content, where you should be at if you've been following along."

## Highlighting Progress and Encouraging Continuation

[00:45:20]
**Bradley:**
Cool. We've shown your progress in a visually tangible way because you can look at each thing that I've shown you on this checklist and ideally you've done it and you can see your progress. Great. Quick win. Solid dopamine hit. Keep going.

## Determining the Placement of the Recap Section

[00:45:28]
**Bradley:**
And so yeah, I don't know if that goes in the very last H2 section or if it goes right before the last H2 section. We'll figure it out. But yeah, we need some sort of recap that comes after the template section. Cool. And that should be really brief but also specific and tangible to clearly demonstrate.

## Defining Completion and Next Steps

[00:45:57]
**Bradley:**
Here's the black and white line. Here's how you know if you've done it. Here's how you know if you haven't finished it yet and what you need to do. So cool. The last H2 section again.

## Preparing for Future Emails and Avoiding Overthinking

[00:46:10]
**Bradley:**
Next steps and tomorrow's email reminder. Pretty self-explanatory. We got that. Cool. At this point, man, honestly, I think the only potential weak spot, the only potential Achilles heel that I can foresee myself getting derailed by.

## Identifying and Addressing Potential Challenges

[00:46:37]
**Bradley:**
Cuz I'm... I just want to do a post-mortem here, right? So my potential Achilles heel that I think is most likely would be overthinking or just overcomplicating the process of figuring out, "Okay, what type of media elements do we need to include such as screenshots or GIFs or little quick video tutorials and embedded walkthroughs?"

## Simplifying Media Inclusion and Referring to Examples

[00:47:17]
**Bradley:**
And just that kind of stuff. Just the logistics of, "Okay, cool, what should I include and what format should it be in? What's the frame rate or the screen resolution? How many of these do I need to include? How do I arrange it?"

[00:47:35]
**Bradley:**
And to basically answer that question preemptively and just pre-resolve that concern and uncertainty or question, I would just say like literally just always refer back to the Write With AI newsletter written by Nicolas Cole and Dickie Bush, right? The creators of Ship 30 For 30. And I would literally just find like two, maybe three max newsletter examples to emulate and designate those as my north stars, right? My Triangle, North Star, constellation, whatever you want to call it. Like, "Okay, here are the two or three role model examples of the type of newsletter I'm trying to emulate."

## Emulating Proven Content and Structure

[00:48:34]
**Bradley:**
And you should have, you know, these should have the sort of content and formatting and structure and flow that I am personally aiming for here in my 5-Day EEC of my own. Because these examples will answer your questions, right? Like once you've seen them, you'll be like, "Oh cool, that's how Cole and Dickie did that. I don't need to ruminate on that."

## Avoiding Overthinking with Multimedia Elements

[00:49:11]
**Bradley:**
And that especially goes for any of the multimedia elements, right? Videos, screenshots, GIFs, especially annotated screenshots. Because I think that's a place that can get really hairy and sneak up on me in a tricky way where I can start to overthink that. Just look at the annotated screenshots they've shown. Doesn't need to be any different or more special or unique than that.

## Simplifying Content Decisions and Maintaining Clarity

[00:49:42]
**Bradley:**
That's it.

[00:49:45]
**Bradley:**
And when in doubt, simplify down, right? Like if you're having a hard time trying to figure out, "Hmm, I'm thinking I should do this in a GIF format because it feels like I need to over-deliver and make sure this is absolutely clear." And maybe you're struggling with the GIF; there's some sort of friction point. If you run into scenarios like that where you feel like you're trying to step up too much in an unnecessary way, that's not going to really make an impact or move the needle in terms of the final result or outcome. Especially from the reader's perspective, I would just go with, "Okay, what is the very next most junior level, right?"

## Selecting the Appropriate Content Format

[00:50:38]
**Bradley:**
Like what is the grade below me? Okay, well, if I'm looking at a GIF, probably the next grade below a GIF would be a screenshot. A screenshot, maybe a screenshot with some annotations, right? And then another grade level below a screenshot with annotations would be just a plain old screenshot with no annotations, right? And you can just sort of, you can even go down the line further.

## Using Hierarchy to Simplify Content Decisions

[00:51:10]
**Bradley:**
You can be like, "What's a level below that?" Well, a level below a plain old screenshot would literally just be like a text description that to the best of your ability describes or shows how this should look, right? You just kind of keep going up or down the rungs on the ladder in terms of what sort of content best, most clearly communicates and presents this in a way that's instantly gettable and immediately a no-brainer in terms of how to apply it now. Right. But if you're running into sort of a glass ceiling, then just take a step back, go back from a yellow belt to a white belt, it's all good.

## Identifying Key Components for Optimal Presentation

[00:52:15]
**Bradley:**
And then for the actual components and elements where it really matters, then step it back up to a yellow belt and you'll be able to easily discern on a gut feeling, intuition level which of these components need to be presented in which format. Right. It should be pretty easy as far as like after you get a few reps in and yeah, I think that'd be the key thing is literally like if you're ping ponging back and forth, just going back and forth between "Should I do this or that?" and you keep switching sides. I would just literally choose one. Choose one of the multiple-choice options for now, like you do on a test in the BYU testing center at 11:45 at night, just before it's about to close because you gotta turn this exam in and at the end of the day clock waits for nobody.

## Emphasizing Decisiveness and Continuous Improvement

[00:53:27]
**Bradley:**
You just gotta get a letter down on the page, just gotta get a bubble down on the Scantron, and if you get it wrong, so what? You come back and you learn from it later. You can always come back like during the second half of the day or tomorrow to go with a fresh set of eyes and review and reread your work to review the multiple-choice option that you chose and that will instantly clarify like, "Oh, actually this other option makes more sense." Or "Oh, actually that was the right option to go with. Like it flows, it makes sense. Cool, we're done here. Moving on."

## Reflecting on Progress and Setting a Stopping Point

[00:54:15]
**Bradley:**
Cool. Man, I have been walking out here at night. It is now 6:16 pm but it's black as midnight and cold as Will Feren, the BYU field goal kicker. Cold as ice. So anyway, that's a solid stopping point for today.

## Transcribing and Reviewing the Voice Note

[00:54:45]
**Bradley:**
Let's plug this voice note transcript into assembly, AI get it transcribed, pull it up, follow it section by section, and let's freaking do this. I want to be a man of substance and have something of material impact to show for my efforts. At the end of the day, I want to have results. I want to have a resume and actual real lived experiences and events that go down on my pedigree, that go down on my track record and show and show you.

## Concluding with Real-Life Examples and Experience

[00:55:40]
**Bradley:**
Hey, man, don't believe me or you want to see what that actually looks like in real life? Let me pull that up for you, and I'll show you a real-life example. Because I've been there, I've done that, I've lived it.

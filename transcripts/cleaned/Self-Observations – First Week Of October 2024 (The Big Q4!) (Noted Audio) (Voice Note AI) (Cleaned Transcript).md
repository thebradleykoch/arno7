# Self-Observations â€“ First Week Of October 2024 (The Big Q4!) (Noted Audio) (Voice Note AI) (Cleaned Transcript)

## Intro

[00:00:05]
**Bradley:**
Alright, so it is... Let's see. I believe... Let's see. Yeah, I forgot what day it is, man.

[00:00:12]
**Bradley:**
It's Wednesday night. I guess I should say Thursday morning. It's about 12:11 a.m. but we'll call it Wednesday night because that's how we roll. So the reason that I want to make this voice note, I feel like this has been... This has been a long one coming, but I feel like the thoughts and feelings and just the ideas that I've been wanting to share have sort of been percolating in the background.

### Inspiration from Espresso Hour Podcast

And actually, to be honest, something... Something that, like, a reason why I want to be more vulnerable and transparent on this voice note than perhaps, than I have been in the past is because I was listening to an Espresso Hour podcast by Cole and Dickie, right? Nicolas Cole and Dickie Bush. My new homies were assumed to be homies.

[00:01:15]
**Bradley:**
And I was listening to this podcast just on Snipd, the Snipd app while I was mowing the lawn. And one of the podcasts they were talking about is basically, like, something caught my eye in the show notes. It was like, looking back on your journals to, like, you need to go back and look at your journals and reflect more often to actually, like, make those changes that you realize that you... That you need to. Right.

[00:01:44]
**Bradley:**
So I actually, like, make any tangible change. It's not enough to just become aware of it and be like, "Oh, yeah, okay, cool. Here's a problem I'm facing. Here's a solution that I think might work." Let's write it down, or let's talk about a podcast, and then we'll close the book, we'll stand up, go get some lunch, and then completely forget... Completely forget that we had that realization and that we're gonna act on it and then come back here, like, 3 months later or a year later, and then, like, pop open that podcast or pop open that journal entry and just realize, holy crap, I took no action on this just because I totally forgot about it. Right?

### Real-Life Struggles Shared by Cole and Dickie

But anyway, I just thought Cole and Dickie did a good job of sharing their everyday, every, like, just real life struggles. And, I mean, one of those was something you might say, "Oh, everybody deals with this," and they do. But like Dickie was describing, he's like, "Man, dude, if I... If I... Like, if my phone is even on, right? Like, I can touch the screen or it's on and it's anywhere near where I sleep, like, my bed, I will get up first thing in the morning and just instinctively, my brain will go to something useless and low effort, like Instagram. And then, like, 30 minutes later, my day's basically gone. Or it's like, it's tanked because it, like, my brain just basically numbed itself with cheap dopamine right at that pivotal starting point of my day, when I actually, like, have the... Have the ability to have the most clear, coherent, breakthrough thoughts."

[00:03:18]
**Bradley:**
And so he's like, "I need to start just trading this cheap dopamine for foundational clarity." And he's like, "So he's like, I'm staying in Amsterdam right now, and I'm at a hotel. And I was tempted because it's like, oh, well, there's a little nice charger plug on a lamppost right next to my bed. But then he's like, now I'm gonna go plug in my phone across the room, and I'm gonna turn it off, like, fully power down my phone."

[00:03:52]
**Bradley:**
"So even in the morning when I... When I go, I can't just like it... I can't instantly open it up and start scrolling, you know?" And then Dickie was talking about something where I don't know if he's doing some sort of martial arts, like Muay Thai. I can't remember what it was, but some type of martial arts class.

[00:04:09]
**Bradley:**
And he was like, "Yeah, man. The instructor was just... Instructor was just, like, basically beating my ass, and I was not... I was just not in a good mood. I was not happy."

[00:04:20]
**Bradley:**
"Like, whatever. The instructor kept trying to correct my form, and it's like, you don't need to hit as hard. You just need to hit with more balance." And then the instructor, it just seemed like what he was doing was effortless. And then Dickie just kept getting basically beat up and was not in a good mood.

[00:04:42]
**Bradley:**
But anyway, he just described a couple scenarios or situations where he has gotten either gotten frustrated or, like, sort of lost himself or, like, let himself go down the drain repeatedly. But then, you know, he's kind of waking up and realizing it. And again, I think these are really, like, normal relatable scenarios, but it's just kind of crazy to me to think, like, okay, well, even guys like Cole and Dickie, who are, you know, my mentors and have built, you know, by now, like, multi-million dollar educational businesses with, you know, ghostwriting and digital writing and all that, like, they still struggle with some of these basic things, and it's not like they're, you know, it's not like your mentors are gods or anything, but I...

### Joining Premium Ghostwriting Academy

Anyway, I just want to say I'm grateful to now be in Premium Ghostwriting Academy, to be in PGA. I just had my onboarding call with Jamie Wilkie today.

[00:05:43]
**Bradley:**
So today's my first, like, official, official week, right? I had the 1 week for $1 kind of trial thing, but this is my first official week of being enrolled, and I sat down on the call with Jamie, and, like, we basically mapped out my roadmap or my game plan for how I'm going to tackle the modules, like, the frequency, the consistency, what dates she expects me to be done with certain things so she can follow up and I can turn in my assignments and all that kind of stuff.

### Confidence in Future Possibilities

So, anyway, I just feel at least a lot more hope and confidence in terms of my possibility curve, like, where we're going from here. And, you know, I know it's absolutely gonna take still a lot of deep work and, like, probably more effort than I've given before because I need to... I need to correct, like, just old dead weight bad habits and, like, start building up some new momentum for myself.

[00:06:46]
**Bradley:**
But I'm willing to put in that work. I'm willing to be accountable. I'm willing to make those changes so that I can actually see those transformations in my life that I feel like were always out of reach beforehand. Before I had access to like-minded friends and coaches and creators, before I had access to social accountability and the type of mentorship and education that I believe is inside of PGA. And honestly, like, PGA is not the end all, be all.

[00:07:21]
**Bradley:**
Like, that's a springboard where it's like, you just... You get into PGA now, you have access to people, you know, either Cole or Dickie or, like, their friends, people that they trust. And now you're plugged into a network of people that are, again, they're not chasing status games. Like... Like, you know, most people do when they go work for companies or most people who are in finance or, you know, summer sales, any of the alternative career paths that I could have taken.

[00:07:54]
**Bradley:**
I just feel like I'm really plugged in with like-minded friends, and they can make introductions for you to other people. Again, it's not limited to just PGA, but, um...

### Cole and Dickie's Origin Story

Anyway, yeah, I was watching a YouTube video, too. It's the last thing I'll say about this, but, um, I... This guy was interviewing Cole, and he's like, "How did you and Dickie meet?"

[00:08:20]
**Bradley:**
He's like, "You know, I had a mentor from..." I believe it was... So I had a mentor from the, like, copywriting, either copywriting agency I was working for in Chicago, or, like, I somehow knew him through my job. Maybe he wasn't his boss or whatever, but, like, he knew him through his previous work. And I'm probably totally making this bits and pieces of the story up, but I'm just gonna paraphrase it to the best of my ability and might throw in some... Some random stuff that wasn't in there.

[00:08:49]
**Bradley:**
But anyway, I think he... Cole was like, "Yeah, I was going... I was talking with him one day, maybe we're going on a walk or hike or whatever, and I was just telling him, I was like, yeah, you know, I'm starting my agency, and it's been great. Like, we're making a ton of money, but I just..."

[00:09:05]
**Bradley:**
"I just feel like it was, like, that prison vs a castle kind of thing. Like, you can build your business into a prison for yourself, or you can build it into a castle, right? Like, you want to avoid the accidental entrepreneurship route of accidentally building yourself into this corner where you're locked in with all these extra responsibilities and you don't have any time freedom or as much financial freedom as you previously thought. So instead, you need to be really intentional about it." Right?

[00:09:35]
**Bradley:**
So, anyway, Cole was like, "Yeah, at this time, I was doing my agency, and I was basically asking this mentor for advice and sharing my frustrations with him." And he's like, "Yeah, you know, to be honest..." Alright. He's like, "There's..." Or I think someone was talking...

[00:09:57]
**Bradley:**
I think that same guy, that same mentor dude just happened to, like, have either met or talked with Dickie fairly recently, for whatever reason. I think Dickie was just starting sort of the inception of Ship 30 for 30. Like, he's doing just a basic... A basic test version to hold people accountable. And anyway, this mentor that both Cole and Dickie knew...

[00:10:21]
**Bradley:**
He basically says to Cole, he's like, "You know, I don't know why, but I just have, like, this gut feeling that you two guys should meet each other. So I'm gonna... I'm gonna..." Like, I can't remember if he put them in an email or text message there or whatever it was. He just basically linked them up, and then, you know, the rest is history.

[00:10:42]
**Bradley:**
But, you know, obviously, Cole had all the experience with actually, like, ghostwriting and a lot of that type of expertise, and then Dickie had a lot of the practice and drive with, like, the social accountability and the mindset aspect of writing. And so Cole and Dickie were like, "Well, sounds like we've got pretty solid, complementary gifts that we can combine. Like, you... You bring the social accountability and the mindset and then I'll bring, you know, my experience ghostwriting for all these different, you know, founders and creators and people, and we'll do this."

### Excitement for Future Opportunities

So, anyway, I just want to say the reason I tell that story is because I think that I truly believe that there are a lot of serendipitous connections and opportunities to meet people going ahead, and I'm excited for that.

[00:11:36]
**Bradley:**
Right. I feel like just being in PGA is a huge, like, a huge foot in the door, like, first stepping stone to just even being exposed to all of these types of people and these types of opportunities where it's like, oh, my gosh, like, now I am... I've stood up off the bleachers, and I've stepped onto the field, right. Like, I'm here. And so just having that exposure, right.

[00:12:04]
**Bradley:**
I know I need to go out, make, you know, make contact with people, introduce myself, actually start attracting people to me by, you know, looking for ways to do my best to, like, you know, publish the content I have, and then also help people with their questions and their challenges, too. So that's definitely something I need to do is more the attract rather than chase or just wait and expect people to come me. But anyway, all I'm saying is that PGA really opens a massive door to that that was previously locked out of before. So I just feel like my... My possibility curve is definitely on the rise.

[00:12:48]
**Bradley:**
So, anyway, Mandy.

### Self-Reflection and Observation

[00:12:55]
**Bradley:**
Cool, cool. So now I guess I will get more into... I'm going to share some self-reflective or self-introspective type things, but I want to more... So get into the nitty gritty, vulnerable, and transparent. And really, what this is, is I'm not trying to, like, overanalyze or, like, diagnose or dissect things so much right now.

[00:13:15]
**Bradley:**
I am just, like, we're starting with just simple self-observation. So I'm gonna... I'm just gonna reflect to you and share some things I've observed over the past couple of days, maybe even weeks. Some of these things will be actions I've taken or activities I've done, people I've interacted with, emotions that I felt both, like, good and bad. And then especially...

[00:13:47]
**Bradley:**
Especially times where I guess the question is, like, what has made me feel alive again recently and made me feel plugged into my purpose? And then also what has made me feel dead inside and disconnected from my purpose? Right. So that's just one sort of, like, two sides of the coin question. I'm sure I can come up with more questions, like, along the same lines, which help me self-reflect and make some, and then eventually make some changes.

[00:14:19]
**Bradley:**
But really, we just want to observe right now. Right. Cool.

### Meditation Experience

So one thing I did meditation this morning. It was, I think, is the Rest and Renew Joe Dispenza meditation that I just have on my phone.

[00:14:30]
**Bradley:**
I've not meditated in a long time, probably months. But I do remember I wrote a journal entry in my Day One journal app, like, years ago, where it was basically, like, I remember my purpose today, something like that, I think I was saying. I just felt like my mind was, you know, muddied. I didn't feel... I didn't really know what I was supposed to do in terms of next steps.

[00:14:57]
**Bradley:**
I just kind of felt lost and disconnected. And then, you know, I prayed, read the Book of Mormon, whatever, and then I just had this impression, like, you should meditate. And I had recently read the book by Joe Dispenza called Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself. And so I think that helped prompt, and I just did... I want to say it was the Rest and Renew meditation, the same one I did today.

[00:15:16]
**Bradley:**
But this was, like, years ago. This was back when I was staying with Palmer Hatch and all those guys at the... At that, like, 2 story apartment across from Vasa.

[00:15:30]
**Bradley:**
But anyway, I think the thing was, I sat down, I did that meditation, meditated, and then, like, got up from that after 20 minutes and just felt so, like, just calm, clear, and just, like, ready to step forward and go. And I, like, immediately after that, just, like, the next things that I needed to do or take care of just, like, smoothly, smoothly flowed into my mind. And it was just, like, it's almost effortless. So it's like the fog is cleared.

[00:16:15]
**Bradley:**
So, anyway, yeah, I think that was just... Just a vivid memory that I had that had an emotional weight to it. And I wrote about that in my journal. I was like, here's the thing. Like, God has given me gifts.

[00:16:30]
**Bradley:**
He's given me tools, and one of these tools is he's given me meditation, right? He showed me, Joe Dispenza, showed me this book. He also showed me this meditation. And, like, when I apply it, which I did that day, like, things just start falling into place naturally, and all of a sudden, all the stress kind of just melts away. And I can...

[00:16:48]
**Bradley:**
I can clearly see what's important, and I can let go of what's not, and immediately, like, the next step just floats into my mind, and I'm able to move forward, and it's no big deal. So, anyway, I did the same meditation today. I do feel like that is something I would like to do more consistently.

### Identifying Decision Points and Bottlenecks

So, one thing, a big picture thing here that I want to get out of this, too, is, like, I'm self-reflecting right now. We're starting with observations.

[00:17:18]
**Bradley:**
Once I feel like I've spilled all those out, I think a next thing that I would want to share is, you know, ask myself, okay, what are, like, the sequences of events or what are, like, the decision tree moments? Right, right. I think it's in Atomic Habits. I think it's called a decision tree. But, like, you know, just these forks in the road.

[00:17:41]
**Bradley:**
Like, where... Where are these forks in the road from me, where I'm either making a tiny, good decision that, like, just gives me a really solid trajectory for the day, or am I making, like, a tiny, not so great decision that, like, domino effects later on. Right. So that's one thing I want to identify after we do these self-observations, right. So I can kind of, like, diagnose where are my biggest bottlenecks or, like, greatest opportunities to improve.

[00:18:09]
**Bradley:**
Now that'll actually make a huge difference after I've become aware of them, and then it's just implementation from there. Right? Like, one of these things I would like to... I would like to do is I... So here's the thing.

### The Importance of Setting Goals

[00:18:25]
**Bradley:**
Whenever I have written down, like, I've had goals written down in my black notebook, and if I'm not consistently reading them out loud 3 times in the morning, like, before I start my stuff, I definitely start to notice that I feel more, like, lost and purposeless and just kind of, like a sense of what am I doing here? Or... Yeah, just... Just feeling kind of, like, flat and also anxious or disconnected. I don't know how to describe it.

[00:18:56]
**Bradley:**
But anyway, I'll ask myself, like, what did I even do today? And how did that even move the needle towards anything? Like, I don't even know. And the thing is, because you haven't actually even set your north stars. Like, you don't have a lighthouse to actually orient yourself towards, right?

[00:19:13]
**Bradley:**
And so that's what you need first and foremost. Before you really figure out what are your lever moving actions or your priorities, you got to find your north star, find your lighthouse.

### Different Types of Goals

[00:19:30]
**Bradley:**
Anyway, so... Yeah, and here's the thing, too. I think, like, I really do like thinking of goals as North Stars, right? Like, they don't have to be... They're more, like, there to give you direction.

[00:19:43]
**Bradley:**
They don't have to necessarily be SMART goals, as in, you know, the SMART acronym. Like, they're different types of goals, right? So sometimes goals can be more like, north Stars, they give you direction, but I will say, like, so on one hand, you have North Star goals right there. They might be a little bit more ambiguous or vague because it's just more, hey, look, this is something I can point to. This is something I'm moving towards in terms of direction, but I don't know exactly when I'm gonna get there or exactly what, you know, the destination looks like.

[00:20:16]
**Bradley:**
And then on the other hand, you have, like, really rigid... These are, like, SMART goals, which is like, here's a finish line, right? So once I achieve my goal, finish line checkpoint, done and over, and then you realize, oh, crap. Well, I guess I got to set new goals or, like, figure out a new purpose, and it's just, like, too focused on the outcome or, like, achieving the goal, but not actually what you're truly striving for, like, striving to develop or evolve into. Right.

### The Lighthouse Goal Concept

But I think a happy medium, at least, that I've thought of, is instead of just thinking of it as either north star goals or finish line goals, think of it as lighthouse... Lighthouse goals, right. Because a lighthouse is like a north star. It has a beacon of light that you can orient yourself towards even when you're lost at sea, right. Something to orient yourself towards and move towards, but it's also, like a physical landmark that you will get to, right.

[00:21:15]
**Bradley:**
So, like, unlike a north star, you can actually, like, the lighthouse doesn't just give you direction. It actually gives you, like, a tangible checkpoint or... Or a destination to reach. And it's not just like a finish line. Cause again, a lighthouse can be something that you just orient yourself towards, maybe.

[00:21:31]
**Bradley:**
Right? Like, anyway, all I'm saying is that you need a combination of, here's the direction I'm striving towards. Maybe I don't need to make it today or make it overly rigid, but also there needs to be some sort of tangible checkpoint or series of checkpoints so I can reflect and be like, yo, I definitely made progress today. And I can point to these, like, 2 or 3 things that I did that prove I made progress on my goals. Right?

### Defining Minimum Viable Efforts

[00:22:01]
**Bradley:**
I mean, one of those things, for example, is just, did I work out today? Right? That's a very binary... Just simple. Did I do it?

[00:22:09]
**Bradley:**
Yes or no? And you could even add a constraint, like, did I work out today? Did I do my 20 minutes workout today? If you want to say this is what constitutes a workout, like a minimum viable workout effort, this is what it is. So that's one thing.

[00:22:26]
**Bradley:**
Because I feel... Because I feel like I've been justified in my mind. Or I'm like, oh, I've been going on walks lately, and this is, you know, I mean, I'm not that fat. Or, you know, I don't feel that terrible, terrible about not working out because I'm still being active in some ways. Like, I rode the bike the other day.

[00:22:45]
**Bradley:**
I'm walking, but then in my mind, I'm like, yeah, man, like, that's great, but who cares, right? Like, these walks, they're for clarity. They're not for sculpting your body, and they're not actually gonna make you feel more manly or, like, more confident to ask the ladies out or just more confident in yourself in general. They're not gonna, like, really raise your testosterone or anything.

### Choosing a Workout Program

So, again, I think, yeah, there's some goals where you got to define what is the minimum viable, like, unit or minimum viable thing that counts as that.

[00:23:17]
**Bradley:**
And so for workouts, it would definitely be something like, maybe I do either a 20 minutes workout. It has a certain number of rounds or, like, sets and reps. So this is one thing, too, dude. I got to decide on a workout program, right? I don't think I need to, like, go all in and order and order the next version of P90X off the Internet.

[00:23:43]
**Bradley:**
Like, I don't think I need to go that hard, but I do need to... Like, I have so many workout and fitness programs that I have bought over the years that are, like, you know, digital products. Basically, they give you all the resources online. And I still... I still own these, dude.

[00:24:00]
**Bradley:**
Like, I still have them, and they're all, like, calisthenics based, right? But, like, I just have not actually committed to these programs. And so I think that's the thing I need to do, is I need to choose a program and just be like, okay, you know what? Like, maybe I've got these 3 options. I've got these 3 different program options.

[00:24:21]
**Bradley:**
Maybe I'm just gonna explore these a little bit. Right? Like a take... Take an afternoon, and, like, I think I already have these things bookmarked, too. I think I recently organized my bookmarks to make sure they're all in a workouts folder on safari.

[00:24:35]
**Bradley:**
Like, take an afternoon, sit down, and be like, okay, you know what? I'm just gonna, like, look through these things, see which... Which, like, workout style and which maybe even which, like, trainer or coach who created the program resonates with me most right now, because obviously, you know, throughout life, when I was a teenager, I might have had different workout mentors than I do now. Right? So anyway, that's something I gotta commit to, is just be like, okay, let me...

[00:25:08]
**Bradley:**
Let me sit down for an hour and just kind of, again, casually explore these programs that I already have, but also do it with some sort of intent or purpose of sussing out, like, which one of these resonates with me most right now and which one do I just feel clicks with me?

### Focusing on Calisthenics and Skills

[00:25:34]
**Bradley:**
So cool. That would be the next introductory step to get me to not just get me to do a workout, man, to do a program, but to actually get me curious and get me excited about, like, learning and educating myself about, you know, exercise again, like calisthenics. And I think a key thing here, too is like, let's... Let's learn about the skills, dude. Let's...

[00:26:01]
**Bradley:**
I know, like, Chris Heria does some education on this in his videos. I don't know if they're... I don't know, like, let's find some resources that are follow along workouts, right? So, like, a video of the person doing the workout with you because the mirror neurons are a real thing, dude. Like, I...

[00:26:17]
**Bradley:**
That definitely makes a difference for me. It's just like, whether it's... Whether it's a P90X workout you plug into the TV or if it's a YouTube workout, just the ability to follow along with someone makes that work out so much easier. So let's do... That's kind of another, I guess, criteria or guidepost for when I'm looking at these programs is do like from the programs I bought in the past that they're all calisthenics.

[00:26:44]
**Bradley:**
Like, they might check some boxes, but which of these would make it easier? Like, most likely for me to actually succeed because of certain things. Like, they have these follow along workout videos, right? And there are other things, too, but yeah. And then also, like, which things can I get excited about, man?

[00:27:07]
**Bradley:**
Like, can I used to be super stoked about learning how to do the planche, right? Learn how to do the plunge, like that gymnastics move. But I'll tell you what, dude, it's been a long time since I have woke up feeling strong. And that's just... Yeah, like, that's just...

[00:27:32]
**Bradley:**
That's just me being straight up honest. I think part of the reason I haven't felt super stoked or motivated to work out recently has been like, I've just... I've let myself go to a certain point, but I just haven't... I haven't consistently been working out enough to the point where I feel like I have that feel good effect. So, like, when I wake up in the morning or, you know, even later in the day, whatever it is.

[00:27:57]
**Bradley:**
Like, I can tell you, man, it has been many, many months, if not years, since I felt, like, strong, since I felt solid, you know?

### Reflecting on Past Fitness Levels

[00:28:09]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. Anyway, dude, I think probably back in... Probably, like, back in 2021 or maybe even earlier, did maybe even... I haven't felt, like, strong strong and, like, solid and just athletic and lean and, like, my true self in that way since probably, like, early 2020, right? Like, before pandemic, before...

[00:28:32]
**Bradley:**
Before I got on Effexor or when I got on Effexor I just started eating every freaking thing in sight. Like, I ate... I would eat, like, multiple Chick-fil-A meals. Cookies, milkshakes. Right?

[00:28:47]
**Bradley:**
That depression drug did a number on me, but I...

[00:28:52]
**Bradley:**
Anyway, just saying, I don't think I have felt, like, solid in terms of fitness since probably, like, early 2020. Probably... I have some pictures. I was pretty... Pretty freakin buff in January 2020.

[00:29:05]
**Bradley:**
That's when we went on our Mexico trip with Jeremy and Annalise and Matt. It's one where we held the tiger... Tiger somewhere in Mexico. I can't remember exactly where. But anyway, I noticed my arms...

[00:29:19]
**Bradley:**
My arms, my physique, very, very well shaped, and I was very lean, too. So, anyway, sometimes I looked... Sometimes mom and dad will, like, pull up just past photos in their photo album. Like, they'll mirror them to the TV off their phone after we do scriptures or whatever, and they'll be like, "Oh, oh, what's cute, kids? Whatever."

[00:29:46]
**Bradley:**
And then there will be a picture of me that pops up from, you know, 2020, 2019, maybe. I'm like, damn, who is that guy? Like, dude, I was... I was jacked. Like, I wasn't big, but I was like, you see those veins?

[00:29:58]
**Bradley:**
You see the... The... You see those... Those forearms, that lean physique, that 8 pack. Anyway, so I guess my question is, in terms of working out, right?

### Impact of Depression Medication on Fitness

[00:30:17]
**Bradley:**
I have realized, okay, number 1, depression medication, anytime that I've been on, it definitely is a factor. In terms of... It kind of robs me of that runner's high. It strips away the feeling that you normally get that makes working out feel good. I've noticed this on both Effexor probably a little bit on Pristiq, but then also on Zoloft, too, man.

[00:30:42]
**Bradley:**
It's almost like it just... It blunts the runner's high, and not even just the runner's high, but just the general, you know, feel good high of working out. So, good thing is, I'm not on those medications anymore, so... That's right. Like, that gate is open.

[00:30:57]
**Bradley:**
I'm not locked behind anything there. I think the main thing for me, I don't know, man. Like, times in the past, I had to impress, felt like I had to impress girls, or I felt like, you know, in high school, you're surrounded by other football players or whatever who are actively working out people, people who, like, are actually in really good shape and looking good and are, like, actively making solid efforts every day. Like, you see them, you're with them, you're watching them do the reps of... It's not, you're seeing them put in the effort and you're seeing the results of that.

[00:31:32]
**Bradley:**
And so when you're just in that close, like, those close quarters, that close environment, that kind of becomes, I don't say the standard, but, like, that becomes almost the status quo of, like, yeah, why... Like, it'd be abnormal to not work out and to not get buff. So, anyway, again, for my situation right now, right, I'm still carless. I don't, like, anticipate meeting up with a gym buddy anytime soon. Like, I'm definitely open to that in the future.

### Working Out at Home and Outdoors

[00:32:04]
**Bradley:**
But again, I'm carless. So I'm probably gonna have to make do with what I have in terms of working around, working out at the house, like, in the garage setup we got maybe even getting out to a park or playground to do some type of either calisthenics exercises or running, just to kind of switch up the scenery and the environment a little bit. Because I do feel pretty depressed when I only work out in one secluded space, like home all the time. Right. So I gotta...

[00:32:36]
**Bradley:**
We gotta figure out some sort of balance there. Um, but, yeah, so that would definitely be another thing. I would say again, like, the mirror neurons thing is a huge boost in that scenario, especially when you're not going to a gym with a workout buddy. If I'm not going to gym with Mason, for example, because I don't have access to that, then we need to basically make up for that social accountability absence, or social feel good vibes in some way. And, like, the follow along workouts is one pretty decent way of doing that.

[00:33:21]
**Bradley:**
It's not exactly the same, but it is a lot better than doing workouts with absolutely nobody along your... Alongside you. Right, cool.

### Brainstorming Next Actions

So I think, like, and really what I'm brainstorming right now, or just sharing is these are some observations. These are, like, really, really simple next actions.

[00:33:42]
**Bradley:**
Wherever... What I like to do is just sit down and I don't know if I'm going to do this in Notion, probably be easier in Notion. And then if I really want to, I can hand write it out in my black notebook where I have my goals. But, like, ideally, ideally, I'd like to convert the stuff in this brain dump that I'm talking about into, well, section it out into different goals or, like, specific changes I want to make. Right?

[00:34:10]
**Bradley:**
So, yeah, anyway, you could create a section that's literally just dedicated to, hey, here's self-observations. And then the next section below that would be, here's all the goals that I want to establish, you know, based on the things I've learned from making those self-observations.

[00:34:31]
**Bradley:**
Or you could also just pair them right up. You could be like, okay, number 1, part a is a self-observation about what I struggle with in terms of working out in the past. And then for that same number, part b is the goal or the thing, kind of like a problem solution type thing.

[00:34:54]
**Bradley:**
But, yeah, man. So anyway, do however you want. But I, that would be really good. And really, these are just like bulleted lists of, um, again, these don't have to be the exact goals that you write out in your black notebook and then rehearse every morning 3 times. But these would more...

[00:35:14]
**Bradley:**
So be like, okay, here... Here is a self-observation I made. Like, I realized that again, mirror neuron workouts, where you're doing follow along workouts, are much more effective for me. So the next action, like, what is the next action I need to take? Like, how much time should I set aside for that?

[00:35:33]
**Bradley:**
What resources do I need? Right? So, for example, I said I saved several of the digital workout websites to a bookmarks folder in my phone in safari. So that's an example of where to find the resources. And then what I need to do is just sit down for an hour, go through those, maybe have a couple bullet points of criteria or requirements I'm looking for that I know would help me be successful.

[00:36:00]
**Bradley:**
And then at the end of that hour, just kind of see what matches up best and then go based on gut feeling. Beyond that, right? I just need, again, I don't need to, like, land on the perfect forever program. I'm literally just going, okay, what are the things that I need to set myself up for success and make success, like, extremely easy? And it's not that success is easy or that you're not gonna have to put effort in, but it's like, if you will observe your own patterns and behaviors in the past of where you have, like, really succeeded with anything.

### Analyzing Past Successes and Failures

[00:36:43]
**Bradley:**
Like, for example, if it's working out, if I've gotten in great shape... Like, just ask yourself, okay, well, what environment were you in? What was... What was, like, did you schedule your workouts ahead of time? Were you doing a certain program?

[00:36:57]
**Bradley:**
What type program was that? Were there any people working out with you? Like, just, if you will, just go back and observe, okay. These were the times where I got the best results, and I was, like, in my prime. Okay, well, what were the factors that allowed you to succeed that really, like, helped you?

[00:37:16]
**Bradley:**
And then in contrast, you also want to pair that with going back to, like, reflecting on a time in your life where it's like, okay, where did I totally just flunk this? Like, where did I not consistently work out at all? Like, what was a stage of life where this happened? And, like, obviously a stage of life wherever anyway. A stage of life where I really wasn't into working out and it was really hard for me to get motivated, whatever.

[00:37:45]
**Bradley:**
And then you just ask yourself the same questions, okay, what was the environment? What was the context, the situation, the background? Was I following a program or not? What were my reasons for caring about keeping my, like, getting myself in good shape? Did I have goals or did I not even have any goals at all?

[00:38:02]
**Bradley:**
And I was just sort of trying to avoid... Trying to avoid fading into oblivion by getting a chunky monkey. No fat belly. But I only worked out 2 days a week because that's the only thing I cared about, was just avoiding a negative consequence. But I didn't actually care about achieving or gaining a positive result or reward.

[00:38:26]
**Bradley:**
Right. So that's just an example. Right? This is really like sales recordings. I mean, all you're doing is, is you are going back, you're relistening or, like, reflecting, revisualizing, remembering the highlight reel.

[00:38:43]
**Bradley:**
Right. What was the highlight reel? Why were those highlights? Like, what contributed to those. What specific factors or things that I did or things that were present or things that were there that I didn't necessarily even have control over.

[00:38:58]
**Bradley:**
But maybe I put myself in a really good environment and so I didn't have to worry about those factors because they're already set up for my success. Right? Like, for example, going to Wichita, Kansas, there's a ton of spiders and there's not a lot of competition. That's one way I set myself up for success. Right?

[00:39:16]
**Bradley:**
And then again, yeah, same exact thing. Contrast. Just the anti vision side of that thing. Okay, so what is the anti highlight reel? Right?

### Applying Observations to Current Situation

[00:39:26]
**Bradley:**
And so we can... I can ask these things to myself for all these areas of my life. I think the main thing is I don't want to spend too much time in the philosophy stage or overly reminiscing and describing in really great detail all these memories and things, but then not actually converting my observations and thoughts into a tangible action I can take now to make a difference, like 2 day going forwards, right? So the goal is, hey, let's reflect. What is the highlight reel for this particular area of life, such as fitness.

[00:40:05]
**Bradley:**
Cool. What was the anti highlight reel? Let's list a few bullet points for each. And then now, like, compared my situation... Now what?

[00:40:15]
**Bradley:**
Which of these bullet points are lining up with me? Are there some from the highlight reel that I have going for me? Are there some from the anti highlight reel that I notice are... Are definitely in effect for me right now. Right?

[00:40:28]
**Bradley:**
So just figure out what variables you need to dial in to get that success that you previously gotten and figure out which ones you need to, you know, like, remove or change. And that's what you're doing, right? Like, you're just dialing... You're just pushing one lever up and push the other lever... Lever down.

[00:40:47]
**Bradley:**
And these levers are these individual bullet points. Within these 2 sides of bullet points on the left is my highlight reel success. Like, factors or variables that directly contributed to my success, whether they were in my control or not, and then anti highlight reel on the right. So factors that contributed to my demise for my failure, my listlessness, whatever you want to call it. And, you know, regardless of whether those things were in my controller, out of my control.

[00:41:20]
**Bradley:**
And then from here, it's just like, okay, now let me... Let me see which bullet points from each side match up with my current situation. Like, today, right now, right this second. Okay. And if 2 bullet points on the left side, which is the highlight reel, like, if those are missing from my life right now, how can I put those back into play, right?

[00:41:46]
**Bradley:**
Like, how can I restart those things? And then if there are any, like, negative factors dragging me down from the anti highlight reel side, how can I get rid of those or reshape? So I'm just realizing right now, duh, I might as well drink my own Kool-Aid and just do this exercise right now. Like, let me just get this out. Let's do that.

[00:42:11]
**Bradley:**
Do an example, right? Real life example. So working out, this is going to be the one we're taking on. So I just dropped the framework. Now I'm going to drop the example.

### Follow Along Workouts and Program Selection

[00:42:24]
**Bradley:**
Cool. So I definitely mentioned follow along... Workouts were a huge thing. Again, the mirror neurons. So if I can get a...

[00:42:32]
**Bradley:**
A workout program that has, like, YouTube videos and I think here's the key difference. Not just videos of the coach or trainer demonstrating individual work, individual exercises, like separately, one at a time, but rather like that coach is on the entire YouTube video. They're going from the start of that workout to the end, like they're doing every set with you. It's not like this. Oh, we filmed you doing a handstand once and then now jump to the next exercise and we filmed you on another day, or we filmed another actor or person or whatever.

[00:43:08]
**Bradley:**
No, it's like the coach or trainer is literally doing rep 1 to rep 1000. Like they are sweating with you the whole way. They are getting exhausted. That's a key distinction with these follow along workouts. I'm not saying, I'm not saying that any workouts that are not follow along won't work.

[00:43:26]
**Bradley:**
I'm just saying they'll be a lot harder for me to, like, just actually make traction and get success. So let's, let's set myself up for success rather than failure. Um, so I know Chris Heria. I know he has his, like, Heria Pro app, and then there's the Thenx app, which is really good for finding, like, programs, right? So this is kind of my conflicting area, is the Thenx app is really well set up for programs.

[00:43:55]
**Bradley:**
Like right now I'm doing the beginner calisthenics program, which is really just helping me rebuild the foundational strength that I need because I used to be very intermediate, maybe even advanced, but since I've lost the strength over the years, I need to start back at the beginner fundamentals, easy versions of the exercises, and build back up. So I think Chris Heria again, Thenx. T h e n x. Athenex. He has some good programs in, like, his 2 different workout apps, which is good because it's much easier to get excited about an actual program that is over, you know, a set number of weeks, and each week has a theme or whatever.

[00:44:38]
**Bradley:**
It's much easier to actually, like, do that and get results rather than just like last minute, spontaneously asking myself, well, what workout do I want to do? I guess I'll go into the workout app library and just pick one, right? Like that is recipe for failure is like last minute, just choosing whatever workout I feel like for that day. Instead, we want to choose a program that's already laid out. It's already pre-proven, it already has balanced workouts and exercises.

[00:45:13]
**Bradley:**
And, like, this is something that the coach or trainer has designed and they know it, it's successful, right? So that's what we're looking for, we're looking for program. But then also I think, and again, maybe, maybe there is a version or solution of this out there that exists that I just don't know about. But the programs in the Heria app, those are more like the asynchronous kind of like it's more like a workout library of exercises. Wherever I, again, they filmed, there's probably like 5 different trainers or whatever and they just filmed these trainers all at different times, different days demonstrating individual exercises.

[00:45:49]
**Bradley:**
But it's not like you're doing one cohesive workout from start to finish with one person who actually does all the exercises. It's just like, hey, here's a video of someone demonstrating the move. Okay, click to rest now. Next exercise, completely different person, right? And that kind of like throws off the, the mirror neuron follow along effect.

[00:46:13]
**Bradley:**
So we gotta see if we can find the best of both worlds. I mean, I know, I do know Chris Heria has a lot of YouTube videos that are more follow along style workouts. I just don't know if those, I don't know. I would assume that those are more one off workouts, though, and they're not necessarily part of a program or as well structured and organized as the workouts are in his app that are packaged as a program. So that's one thing we've got to dig into and find out.

[00:46:42]
**Bradley:**
There are probably at least 2 more workout programs upon in the past that I need to check out. I'm just not as familiar or like, my memory isn't as fresh with them because it was years ago. So I can't remember how they're structured exactly or if they had follow along videos. So I'll have to go back and look at those. But, um, yeah, again, I'm not, I'm not like trying to force fit or like endlessly search for the perfect solution.

[00:47:09]
**Bradley:**
I'm just trying to find, okay, out of these options I have what solution checks the most boxes and checks like the most important boxes or variables or factors that I need to set myself up for success based on my highlight reel of success in the past and the variables and factors that were, you know, in play then.

### Next Steps for Workout Program Selection

[00:47:37]
**Bradley:**
Cool. So, yeah, man, that's next task or action. Just like set aside an hour to go through these 3 or so workout programs and just kind of make a short bullet list of criteria or things looking for and then identify, okay, does this program meet what I'm looking for? So I could easily do this in my black notebook. Just kind of like draw really rough sketch, like, table with each workout, and then success criteria is a row on the left.

[00:48:05]
**Bradley:**
Like, you have each row anyway, something like that. So you see which ones, check the boxes, which ones don't cross compare.

[00:48:18]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. So let me think now.

### Motivation for Working Out

[00:48:23]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, man, I think that's it. Because, I mean, here's the thing. I, like definitely growing up and even, like, up to this point, I think working out to, like, look good and feel good in the presence of attractive women, specifically attractive girls that I might potentially go on dates with or even marry. Like, that's definitely... That's definitely a motivating factor for working out.

[00:48:51]
**Bradley:**
But it is a very, like, fickle and unreliable one, because, again, like, unless you're constantly in the presence of these girls going to the gym, like, then that motivation factor is just not going to be switched on. And then also, the other problem is once you get married, well, then that motivation factor slides again because you don't need to impress anyone anymore, right? Not technically, but... So anyway, I... So I acknowledge that's a factor.

[00:49:21]
**Bradley:**
But also, you know, I don't want to lean on it too much, but, you know, maybe write down some notes about it or some goals I have in the way I want to feel. I think... Here's the thing, too. So my family is going on... So right now it's October 2, right?

### Upcoming Family Vacation and Fitness Goals

[00:49:41]
**Bradley:**
October 2, 2024. And my whole family... So my mom, dad, my brother, my 2 sisters, and then also my brother-in-law, who's married to Audrey. Like, we are all going on a family vacation at the end of November. It's kind of like Thanksgiving weekend, I think.

[00:49:59]
**Bradley:**
And it's going to be... Be... It's gonna be a cruise. I can't remember exactly where. I don't know if it's, like, a Bahamas cruise or somewhere else.

[00:50:07]
**Bradley:**
But the reason I bring that up is because, like, a lot of times at different social get-togethers in the past, especially things that involve, like, swimming or water sports, like boating at the lake, we've had several things like that with friends or family reunions just this past summer. And I, like, just decide, I'm just gonna stay in the boat. Like, I'm not gonna... Or I'm not gonna go swimming. I'm gonna keep my...

[00:50:36]
**Bradley:**
My clothes on, and I'm not gonna, like, participate in the fun. Like, I'll still act like I'm having a good time, but I don't wanna... I don't wanna, like, take my shirt off or whatever, because I'm not in, like, the type of shape that I know my true self should be in.

[00:50:54]
**Bradley:**
Right. And I mean, again, like, compared to a bunch of other people, my family or other friends, like, I'm in pretty decent shape. It's more of a self-conscious thing. But it's like, I... I'm kind of tired of, like, sitting...

[00:51:10]
**Bradley:**
Sitting out of these activities just because I don't feel confident, like, in my fitness and strengthen and physique because I haven't been taking care of myself. And then, like, having to sit out on some level or, like, sit back or, like, throttle myself down or just, like, participate in the half-baked version of that experience and not actually, you know, not actually get to ride the water tube behind the speed boat because I'm too nervous to take my dang shirt off. Right. It sounds really stupid, but at the end of the day, it's, like, it's an easy problem to solve. Right?

[00:51:49]
**Bradley:**
I don't need to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I just need to, like, get in decent shape to the point where I feel like I am my true self. Right. Cool. So that could be a motivating factor, because I'm sure, like, I don't know for sure, but I'm sure there will be some opportunities to swim or, you know, be at the beach or whatever with this cruise that's coming up that's basically a little bit less than 2 months away. So that could be an incentive.

[00:52:17]
**Bradley:**
Right? That's... That could definitely be a factor. So I don't know how I want to approach that, whether it's just imagining myself, like, feeling comfortable in my own skin and being able to fully participate in those activities without holding myself back or, like, putting a wet blanket on the mood because I'm nothing... Jumping in with everybody else.

[00:52:37]
**Bradley:**
I don't know, man. We'll figure out a way to, like, emotionally visualize that both the stakes, like, the cost of inaction if I don't take action and what those experiences will feel like, both for myself and then also, like, my siblings and my family members when they know I'm not participating. And then that contrasted against, like, the happiness or the joy or fulfillment that I will feel when I do get to participate in those things, like, without holding back, without feeling constrained or embarrassed or insecure, you know, just not... Not having to hold myself back, just being free. So we can talk more about that later.

### Setting a Timeline for Fitness Goals

[00:53:19]
**Bradley:**
But that could be a good factor in terms of even, like, a timeline of, hey, for these next 2 months, I'm gonna commit to this program. And, like, that's my timeline. That's my target. Or my sprint. And I don't know, that'll give me something to look forward to, but also, like, a good period of time to actually consistently start making this habit of working out following a program.

[00:53:48]
**Bradley:**
So, yeah, that'll be a factor to consider. Um, what else?

### Preference for Calisthenics and Skill-Based Workouts

[00:53:56]
**Bradley:**
What else, man? Oh, here's one thing.

[00:54:01]
**Bradley:**
So here's one thing, too. So I'm... I'm in the past, like, I used, I used to work out using regular weights and gym equipment when I was a teenager. But then probably when I was like, 14 or 15, I started getting more interested in calisthenics. And not just, not just wimpy calisthenics.

[00:54:19]
**Bradley:**
I'm talking, like, street workout, gymnastics style calisthenics, handstands, muscle ups, that kind of stuff. And I just, I realized and I still feel the same, the same way. I enjoy that style of exercise and fitness so much more because you're actually working on the skill portion of it, right? Like, there are so many different minor progressions that you can learn in building up to a full, true handstand and then even beyond, like, you could do a one arm handstand, for example. I guess the thing is, the progressions are just so, like, there's so many levels, and that's what makes...

[00:54:59]
**Bradley:**
Makes it exciting. It's almost like a game. And that, to me, like, being able to, being able to get traction and, like, mark off these checkpoints or achievements as I ride the progressions, these, like, cool, cool, skill-based calisthenics exercises, that is so much more exciting to me than being like, "Oh, yeah, I added another 10 pound weight plate to my bench press." But the bench press move itself hasn't changed, and it's just as boring to watch me do it like that... That is not as cool as being like, "Oh, yeah, dude, last month I couldn't hold a handstand, but now I can..."

[00:55:40]
**Bradley:**
"I can hold a handstand for 30 seconds. Like, I have a skill now that I literally did not have." It's just a completely different thing. So that's why I enjoy calisthenics so much more, because I just feel like it's more gamified. There's more, like, progressions to it.

[00:55:53]
**Bradley:**
There's other factors, too, like balance, flexibility, that don't really come into play with traditional weightlifting. Right. So that is something that I can do is like, hey, maybe I pick out 3 core fundamental skills that I want to work on, and I sort of embed those into the training. And here's the thing. I gotta track my progress to, like, and not just numbers, not just like, hey, let me weigh myself.

### Tracking Progress and Visual Documentation

[00:56:18]
**Bradley:**
That's not enough. No, I need to do, like I need of myself doing a handstand against the wall for as long as I can and, like, record that video and then watch it back so I can see, is my form good? Am I struggling? Whatever. And then, you know, the next week I'll take a new video, and the next week I'll take a new video.

[00:56:41]
**Bradley:**
And ideally, we... I should be, like, capturing these incremental moments of progress, especially in a visual way, like, through video, because that's important with these calisthenics moves is form. But then also, yeah, you know, what level of progression can you do? And how long can you hold it? Or how many reps can you do?

[00:57:04]
**Bradley:**
But I just need some sort of, like, very tangible visual way and quantifiable way of documenting my progress. And I think if I can fall in love with documenting my progress, even when I suck at the beginning, because I'm totally cool with sucking at the beginning, if I can just fall in love with the process of, like, capturing... Capturing my best effort where I'm at, getting a video, writing down my number of reps, and then, like, storing that all in a place that I can then make visual again. So I don't know if that needs to be, like, in a certain place on my phone that I see every day or if I need to get a poster on my wall where I, you know, mark things off, mark checkpoints off something, like a poster in my wall, on my bedroom wall that I see every single day that would... I know I've done that in the past, and that has been effective for other goals.

[00:57:58]
**Bradley:**
Like, when I did door-to-door summer sales, selling pest control in Kansas, that was one thing I did. I just had a big old poster, basically had squares, like, just squares, like a grid. And I marked off 700 individual spots because I was like, my goal is to sell 700 accounts. And just seeing that every day and then marking my progress off every day of how many sales I made that day and then waking up to, like, that's the first thing I see when I pop my head out of bed. Like, that made a huge difference.

[00:58:29]
**Bradley:**
So maybe we do both. Like, I... I have a convenient, like, place or way of storing these things on my phone. Like, the videos of me doing a certain calisthenic skill progression, like a handstand or a pistol squat. And then also, like, the record of kind of like, a table of the reps and the exercises I did so I can see my week over week, you know, changes and then also the changes in my form from the videos.

[00:58:59]
**Bradley:**
And I can put that in a digital place on my phone. And then, you know, whether I gotta save the app to my home screen from page to make it more visible, I can do that. But then also doing a hybrid approach of, I don't know, maybe, maybe I get like a poster or something this week that I can, like a plastic, almost like a whiteboard, but a poster version that I can use a dry erase marker on and just sort of map out these checkpoints. So, yeah, make it visual. Very easy to see.

### Synergistic Effects of Exercise on Other Health Habits

[00:59:35]
**Bradley:**
That'll be good. Let's see, what else? What else? I think so some of the other health benefits start to naturally fall into place after you start making an effort in one area. For example, if I start going ham where I'm like, okay, I'm committed to this exercise program for the next 2 months, which means I'm going to be working out on these specific days and I'm gonna be tired and I need to, like, get some solid, high quality and, like, high quantity sleep to actually recover and, like, grow my muscles from the workout I did then that just incentivizes me to get a much better sleep in.

[01:00:26]
**Bradley:**
Right. Which basically helps me to actually want to go to bed on time and then want to wake up at a certain time and just like, prioritize other areas of my life that are related to this health goal, that it's kind of like a synergistic effect. Right. Consistency of the combination. That goes for diet, too.

[01:00:45]
**Bradley:**
Like, if you, once you start working out consistently, you start feeling like, actually, I actually want some vegetables with this chicken instead of just eating the chicken and then eating a piece of white bread afterwards because you don't care. Right. So anyway, so I think, like, with diet and sleep, those are some things that I can definitely implement. I don't think I need to be as, like, super worried or, like, hyper focused on dialing in those things. Dialing in those things at the very beginning of this, like, new effort to work out, just because I think I'll naturally start wanting to sleep at a better time for a better length of time and then also, like, eat more consistently healthy, I don't want to just overwhelm myself and be like, oh, you got to track your workouts and also your sleep and also your diet because that can be really overwhelming if you try to introduce too many, too many habits at once.

[01:01:51]
**Bradley:**
Right. So I might eventually start tracking my sleep and my diet, but let's just like, let's focus on the main fitness habit that is going to drive the rest of the fitness habits, which in my case, I believe is getting on compatible workout program that I genuinely enjoy, that I have an interest in, that I'm excited to build the skills in that will teach me those skills and then, yeah, will just help me like, adapt, level up and be able to do cool things, unlock new skills or benefits that I haven't had for years or ever before.

### Implementing "Skill of the Week"

I will say, I mean, one more thought on this, because I do want to move on. I just want to get basically like a minimum viable, you know, set of goals and then also list of behavior changes that I need to make based on my observations of my, like, highlight reel moments vs anti highlight reel moments surrounding this goal or area of life. So one thing I noticed, I tried to implement this in the past and it kind of worked for like a week or 2. And then I think everybody, including me, just kind of got complacent and then didn't really follow through with it. So the thing I'm talking about is, I suggest that I was like, how about I said to my family home, I was like, how about we do skill of the week, right?

[01:03:29]
**Bradley:**
Where like, maybe we pick a skill that we want to do, such as a handstand. And it doesn't matter if you've never done a handstand before in your life or if you're a pro, because there's a million different progressions or levels of a handstand, and you can find one of those that you can work on at your current level. So we'll pick an exercise like that, you know, that has progressions for everyone. And this week we will practice that skill, right? And I did that.

[01:03:59]
**Bradley:**
Like, I did that with my youngest sister. I think we're decently consistent for, like, the first week of doing a handstand. And then we tried to do a new skill and it just seemed very sporadic, partially because our workout schedules were different, our general life schedules were different, too. And also, like, I, even though I'm the oldest, I'm actually the only one still living at home right now with my mom and dad. Hopefully I will be, you know, moving out independently on my own soon, but still probably be a matter of another 6 months or so.

[01:04:35]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, what I'm saying is family dynamics. It's not like every sibling or every person that would potentially participate in skill of the week is actually going to be, like, physically in the same location. It's kind of hard to make convenient but with that being said, I do think that there's still ways that some sort of, like, uniting social accountability fitness activity could work, especially if you all share the same goals and make it fun. So, like, my younger sister and my younger brother, they're both up at BYU and Utah right now, so. And I'm in Las Vegas.

[01:05:14]
**Bradley:**
So obviously I'm not gonna drive up for... Drive up for a day to do skill of the week with them. But I do have another sister who's here in Vegas. She comes over on weekends. Right.

[01:05:28]
**Bradley:**
It's like once, maybe once a week. So I guess we could do some, some of the skill of the week work together. And again, skill of the week isn't like a full on workout. It's more like, hey, I'm gonna do 2 or 3 sets of pull ups, right? And I can only do 1 pull up, or I can only do like, 2 assisted pull ups with the band, but I'm gonna do 2 or 3 sets of this one specific skill, and I'm just gonna do this consistently, like, whether it's every day or every other day or just whenever you get a chance.

[01:06:02]
**Bradley:**
Again, it's not a full on workout, but it's just like, it's one specific skill, right? So, I mean, one way we could implement that. Again, I think social accountability is one of the major things that has sort of been lacking for me in recent years, but is one of those factors that actually does motivate me when I have it, or at least, like, even if I don't enjoy working out, like, the social accountability does get me to work out, at least it, like, gets me out of the house and into the gym, and then I start enjoying it a little bit more. So one thing that comes to mind, I don't know. I talked about recording my progress earlier.

[01:06:42]
**Bradley:**
Like, I can take, I need to take some sort of video, like some video of my progress. So a video of me doing a handstand against the wall and holding that as long as I can. And then maybe, like, I have a timer going in the background too, so I know how many seconds I did, and then I send... Maybe we create a new, like, family group chat for the family members or friends, whoever wants to participate in skill of the week. We have that just like a chat thread or iMessage thread, and we each send in our accountability progress videos and we can decide what exactly that looks like, you know, how often we send those, if there's a reward or an incentive that we can work towards.

[01:07:39]
**Bradley:**
I know my family in the past has done. They're like, oh, let's do a treat fast. Basically fast from all, or candy and stuff for however long, and then, like, everybody pitches in $20 to the pot and then, like, last man standing wins. So if you can go several months without dessert and everybody else folds before you, then you get all the money in the pot. That's great.

[01:08:01]
**Bradley:**
I don't really care to, like, contribute money to a pot like that, but I think you can still have a similar, like, gamified structure or setup with an fun incentives that involve social accountability just like that. So again, I don't know what the exact incentive would be. Maybe we all participate in an activity or do an event together. If we, if we successfully do skill of the week on the, on the, like, correct number of times or schedule, and then we actually submit our videos or whatever form of progress that we're tracking and sharing with the group. If we share that progress and do the things that we promise to do, then maybe there's some sort of incentive, right?

[01:08:52]
**Bradley:**
I don't know. Maybe. I'm sure, Arno, you can help me come up with a much better, like, more fun and also, like, compelling and useful social accountability type of structure that's, that's gamified and fun and helps us achieve our goals. So anyway, though, that's it for this whole, like, fitness / working out section. I feel like I've, yeah, I feel like this is really solid.

### Next Steps and Seeking Advice

[01:09:26]
**Bradley:**
So, I mean, another, like, concrete action that I can take. In addition to sitting down for an hour and, like, evaluating and picking out a workout program to do over the next 2 months, another thing I can do is maybe like, pass this voice note, this voice note transcript to Arno. And just for like, 20 or 30 minutes, let's say we'll set aside 30 minutes, and I'll just be like, "Yo, Arno, um, as far as these other, like, here are the factors that I've pinned down. Here's what I've done to, like, implement them so far. Like, here's what I'm committed to."

[01:10:08]
**Bradley:**
"And then also here are the questions I haven't answered yet. Such as, like, how could we, how could we do this thing? Whether it's skill of the week or some other sort of friendly competition where we all are again participating in the same exact shared goal, I think that's the key thing, too, is like, things begin to fall apart when, when everybody is doing different things. So it's like, even if you're all doing fitness goals, but, like, your sister is training for a marathon, and you are training for a bodybuilding competition, and then your brother is training for track and field, and then your other sister is training for rock climbing. Like, you could do a competition where it's just, hey, if you worked out today, regardless of what sport or whatever you're competing in or what skills or what goals you're working towards, if you just worked out great, that counts."

[01:11:04]
**Bradley:**
"But I feel like that is a lot harder to really care about motivation wise over the long run because your goals are just so different and you're not really celebrating the same progress or achievement."

[01:11:19]
**Bradley:**
"Whereas if you are all, if you're all like, yeah, okay, everyone, for skill of the week, this week we're doing handstands, and here are all the different progressions you could do. So you just pick one that's at your level. Doesn't matter if you're a beginner or advanced, but, like, this is the, we're all doing the same move, we're doing the same exercise, we're working on the same skill, and we're all trying to get to, you know, we're trying to increase one progression level by the end of the month or whatever it is. You know, that way, like, everyone is actually working on the same goal, the same skill, but it still allows for flexibility in terms of everybody's, like, starting point or natural ability. So that's much more motivating than just saying, hey, everybody work out today, and you're all working on separate goals that are not aligned."

[01:12:12]
**Bradley:**
Right. So anyway, that's just kind of a question I have, and these are a bunch of observations. I'm just wondering, hey, is there, how would you approach this? What are maybe 2 or 3 different ways we could do this that would be fun, that would make this gamified and, like, actually effective and also, like, easy to do something that doesn't take a lot of time or, like, effort doesn't really take away any energy or anything from the other stuff I got to do in my day, right. I want to keep it simple, fun, effective, solid, friendly competition.

[01:12:50]
**Bradley:**
And at the end of the day, everybody should walk away having gotten, like, 1 or 2 levels better than they started, regardless of if there's, you know, an incentive where only one person wins something. Maybe there's a different incentive structure where everybody wins something, but, like, the person who makes the most progress wins the best thing. I don't know. Anyway, questions to answer going forward.

[01:13:22]
**Bradley:**
Cool. Cool. So that is the end of my workout fitness goals section. Not just goals, but, like, immediately actionable things that I can implement to, like, take next steps to start... Start transforming my behaviors and then, like, actually start taking the bigger steps towards my goals and actually making them happen.

[01:13:49]
**Bradley:**
So, um... Cool.

## Adderall Usage and Challenges

[01:13:58]
**Bradley:**
Let's move on to this. So this is a little bit of a touchy subject. Even... Even for me talking out loud to the midnight sky, I still feel a little bit insecure or vulnerable about this. But I'm gonna share it anyway because I got to...

[01:14:17]
**Bradley:**
I got it if I want to make progress. So, um, let's see. So I've been back on Adderall for the past 2 days. I just picked it... Picked...

[01:14:32]
**Bradley:**
Picked it up at Smith's yesterday, I believe. Yeah, yesterday dad drove me there after work. I went to go do help April with the bills at dad's work. But anyway, prior to that, I had been off of Adderall for about 10 days. Just like, pretty cold...

[01:14:52]
**Bradley:**
Pretty much cold turkey setup. Again, I had consumed at too fast a pace. I had over consumed my monthly allotment and basically consumed 30 days worth of Adderall in 20 days. And again, a lot of that... The reason I have struggled with that has just been due to stress and not being able to and me having a hard time navigating out of that.

[01:15:23]
**Bradley:**
I don't know if you want to say compulsion or just, like, default habit of feeling like, oh, my gosh, you know, whatever I did today, it wasn't enough because I don't feel like I've made enough progress. I don't feel like I've reached, like, a satisfying or fulfilling checkpoint where I can look back on what I did today or this past week and be like, yeah, I'm definitely moving forward. I'm in a better position. And so as a result, I feel like I'm behind. I feel like I'm trying to catch up, whether that's to everybody else in life or whether that's just to, like, where I know I should be and where I could be, whatever it is.

[01:16:03]
**Bradley:**
Then again, because I associate Adderall with getting things done, which, like, that is a true association. It's not just a placebo effect, but it's like, okay, well, like, it's okay. I might have, you know, gotten distracted earlier today or maybe nothing... Maybe not, like, been as deliberate about just putting on the blinders and getting the most important thing done and I let distractions in or, like, lesser priorities in. And so, well, I guess it's okay if I take another pill tonight and as long as I get whatever done that I said I would or maybe I can even get a head start on tomorrow.

[01:16:45]
**Bradley:**
And that's how I can justify taking this extra pill now. Right. And, like, logically... Okay, so that's the logic or the justification that comes in my mind a lot. That alone would not be enough to, like, tip me over the edge.

[01:17:00]
**Bradley:**
But then when you add in the actual, like, emotional stress and feeling of just, like, oh, my gosh, like, I actually do... I do got it... Like, make some sort of moves. Like, I got to move the needle to something.

[01:17:16]
**Bradley:**
Like, I don't want to go to bed tonight feeling like all the effort I put in today, wherever that effort went, like, whether it was lost through distractions or whatever, I just don't want to go to bed feeling like I'm in the same exact place waking up tomorrow as I was waking up today, as I was waking up a year ago or 2 years ago. Right? And so then you're like, okay, cool. Let's just pop the pill. Cool.

[01:17:40]
**Bradley:**
And it's very hard, like, for me, especially at the beginning of the month, I don't really feel very closely connected to the Bradley living at the end of the month who will inevitably run out early due to my decisions and will have to suffer the consequences of my bad decisions now because it's like, oh, man, I'm feeling really stressed out right now. Like, here's a simple... Just pop a pill, and we can make some more progress on this. And you can go to bed feeling like you've reached a solid checkpoint. And, like, if you've reached that checkpoint, then, like, even if you run out a little early, at least, like, you...

[01:18:20]
**Bradley:**
You worked your way ahead and you don't need to worry about catching up at that point. Right. So it's almost like, yeah, your future self might miss out on a little bit of his medication that he should have, but it's all good because I got you. I'm gonna work ahead. I'm gonna get these things done so you don't have to worry about it.

[01:18:38]
**Bradley:**
So, like, it doesn't matter that you don't... It won't be as bad that you don't have the medication because I'm gonna take care of what you were originally gonna do, but I'm gonna do it now. I'm gonna take it off your plate. Right. So there's a lot of levels of, like, justification to this that are obviously very flawed.

### Reflections on Past Experiences

[01:19:00]
**Bradley:**
And I will say so, like, in my defense, on some level, there have been, and I don't think this is the best way to go about life or learning new things or discovering new things. I'm just gonna say there have been times where I have, you know, been awake for, like, 2 or 3 days, and then finally I discover something, like, super useful, because I was just going at it, like, trying to solve one stupid problem for so long that I finally found the answer. And... And I think, again, the next faulty belief for the faulty justification that comes after that, in my mind, is like, well, I don't know if I would have discovered this solution to my problem if I hadn't stayed awake on Adderall for all that time, because I probably just would have been asleep and maybe never would have found this solution that I just sort of...

[01:19:54]
**Bradley:**
I just sort of happened on, or whether it was a result of my persistence or a result of luck or whatever, right? And I think that is a faulty belief. Like, I'm very confident that if I were to let go and just be like, you know what? Maybe it would be nice to make some more progress tonight, but I... My brain and my body are going to be much better off, like, resting and healing and repairing themselves from the effort I've given today, and they will come back so much stronger with more clarity and strength tomorrow.

[01:20:29]
**Bradley:**
And, like, I'm... Because of that, I'm cool with letting go of, like, this extra pill that I could take tonight because I know... Sorry, excuse me. Because I know that the, like, refreshed, revitalized version of Bradley that will wake up tomorrow morning will be much better equipped to handle the stuff that I'm trying to do tonight because he won't have all the, you know, brain fog and all this kind of stuff. So, like, I can let it go.

[01:20:58]
**Bradley:**
Right? I have been successful in taking that mental approach several times in the past, but again, like, that's not the default. I really have to fight and... And I really have to fight to persuade my mind to even, like, give that a shot, you know?

### Observations on Adderall Usage Patterns

[01:21:19]
**Bradley:**
So, anyway, I'm just gonna put some observations out there. Okay. So I think by the time the end of the month comes and I run out, I start feeling very... Just stressed. I'm just like, well, I guess that's it.

[01:21:32]
**Bradley:**
Like, maybe I should just go to bed for the next week and not do anything, because I don't really have any... I don't really have a pick me up to look forward to. And I know that, like, starting very quickly in the next couple days, I'm gonna start feeling some strong withdrawal symptoms. I'm basically just gonna be feeling like I've gotten the... The life sucked out of me, and it's gonna be very hard to do.

[01:21:58]
**Bradley:**
Even just basic day to day things, like getting up and I... Getting... Getting dressed, doing my laundry, whatever.

[01:22:08]
**Bradley:**
And, like, when it comes to work, man... Man, if it's something that needs, like, a deep intensity and can't be done with just, like, a somewhat surface level brain dump or just, like, low pressure client interview, call. If it's something where I really have to do more, like, deep work on the computer or really think through something, whatever it is, like, those type of things are really challenging without Adderall. And so I think I... When I'm in a state where I don't have it anymore because I've run out early, I tend to just, like, totally avoid those types of tasks as long as possible, right?

[01:22:51]
**Bradley:**
Like, unless I have a majority deadline for a client, I almost just default to, like, whoa... Yeah, I could move on to that next step in my project, but I'm gonna be useless at it right now, so I'm not even gonna try, like, punt that down the field, procrastinate it, wait till I get my next refill kind of thing. And here's the thing, dude. So I did... I did the math, and it's like, if...

[01:23:18]
**Bradley:**
If I continue down this road, right, if I continue where I am 20 days on and 10 days off, and real quick, that's not to say, like, the 10 days that I'm off federal, I'm not totally useless. Like, I still function. It's just that probably a good 5 or 6 of those 10 days, at least, are really rough. And I'm like, I'm sick. I'm down.

[01:23:43]
**Bradley:**
Withdrawal symptoms. And, like, they're just not... They're just not, like, normal... Normal quality of level life days. They're just kind of days where you kind of...

[01:23:56]
**Bradley:**
Kind of wish you were dead or kind of wish you were sleeping or in a coma just so you could fast forward time. Um, but let's even be conservative. So, like, let's say if I... If I keep going down this route and let's say that... So, say 7 days, right?

[01:24:13]
**Bradley:**
So even if I consume 30 days of Adderall over 20 days and there's 10 days left where I'm going to be off of it, let's just say that 7 of those 10 days are pretty crappy. Or I'm at least definitely, like, achieving below my potential because I'm avoiding... I'm avoiding the hard stuff. That's... That I need...

[01:24:34]
**Bradley:**
That I need to do that I would otherwise do if I had just preserved my normal medication schedule, right? So say 7 days a month. That's 1 week a month. 7 days out of a month. If I keep this pattern up.

[01:24:51]
**Bradley:**
Let's see, what is that? So 7 times 12 is 84. Is that right? Yeah. So 84, 80...

[01:25:04]
**Bradley:**
Holy crap, man. So that's 84 days a year. So 365 divided by 84. Or... Let's just make it simple.

[01:25:13]
**Bradley:**
So there's a sue weeks. Okay, 52 weeks in a year and 1 week per month that you're not really active. So 1 times 12 is 12. Okay, so 52 minus 12 is what?

[01:25:29]
**Bradley:**
Sorry, I... I'm walking through and it's broad and my brain is just kind of gas from walking and talking. And it's late. So anyway, okay, 52 minus 12, that's 40. So let's say you're...

[01:25:43]
**Bradley:**
You're really only living like 40 decent quality... Decent life quality weeks a year out of 52 potential weeks, right? So let's see how many weeks you're gonna lose over the rest of your life if you keep this up. So what is that, 12 weeks a year? Let's say I'm 27 now.

[01:26:06]
**Bradley:**
Let's just round me up to 30. So 12 weeks a year, and let's say I live to be 80, right? So easy math. 80 - 30 is 50 over the next 50 years. Making these assumptions over the next 50 or so, 50 times 12 weeks a year that I'm basically forfeiting, just like opting out of life.

[01:26:34]
**Bradley:**
12 times 50 is what?

[01:26:42]
**Bradley:**
Sorry. 12 times 5 is 50... 60, right? Yeah, that's 60. So 12 times 5 is 60...

[01:26:54]
**Bradley:**
Is that right? Man, my times tables. 5 times that if you do 2 times 5... Yeah. Okay, so 60, 12 times 5, 12 weeks times 50.

[01:27:10]
**Bradley:**
So we got 60, but then out of zero. So 600. So 600 weeks. Right. I might as well just pull out the calculator, man.

[01:27:19]
**Bradley:**
Sorry. But 600 weeks, man. How many years is that? So if you do 600 divided by 50, is that 12...

[01:27:35]
**Bradley:**
Let's see. I'm sorry. So again, 50 years from the time I'm age 30 to ten time I die at age 80. Let's just say. So 1 week every month, that's 12 weeks a year.

[01:27:51]
**Bradley:**
12 times 12 weeks times 50 years equals 600 weeks.

[01:28:00]
**Bradley:**
And then we do 600 divided by 52 to see how many years that is. Okay, man, that is 11.538 years. So just round it up so if I can... Geez, dude, that's actually... That's higher than I expected.

### Realizing the Potential Life Lost

[01:28:22]
**Bradley:**
I thought it's gonna be high, but that's high. So again, I know I'm making assumptions here, but this is like, you got... You got to pay the stakes, dude. So if I continue with the same patterns that I have, like, just allowed myself to fall into over the last... I'd say year, but probably more than a year with...

[01:28:43]
**Bradley:**
I'm trying to think, when did I first start struggling with, like, over consuming Adderall? Because I didn't... I didn't have that problem on my mission. I didn't have it, like, really in college or during summer sales until maybe... Maybe it was 2020.

[01:29:01]
**Bradley:**
Was it 2020? It might have been 2020. Okay. The end of 2020. I remember it was, like, November 2020 when I had my psychiatrist up my dose.

[01:29:11]
**Bradley:**
So I went from 40 milligrams a day to 60. And I do remember because I didn't have the same school schedule or anything as anybody else, I just basically allowed myself to go nocturnal, which was bad. So, yeah, man, I would say, like, end of 2019, but let's call it beginning of 2020 was really when I started by over consuming and having sleep just, like, sleep disturbances or sleep issues where I was not giving myself enough sleep like I had been before.

[01:29:52]
**Bradley:**
Why am I saying this right now?

[01:29:58]
**Bradley:**
So, yeah, man. Anyway, I think I've exhibited different levels of this. Like, when I... When I was at my worst, October 2021... Like, during that year, dude, I mean, there were times where I would basically, like, sleep for a week, a week, wake up for 3 days, and then go back to bed for a week.

[01:30:17]
**Bradley:**
So I honestly just do not know. I mean, I just don't even remember. I do not know how much, like, life I just lost or just gave up on, flushed down the drain from, you know, popping sleeping pills, like, overstressing myself on Adderall, first off, and then deliberately, like, popping sleeping pills during the day because my... Because it was easier to, like, sleep through the day rather than face the nightmare that my reality had become. And so, anyway, man, I'm not gonna even try to estimate for that.

[01:31:00]
**Bradley:**
I know it was... I was definitely sleeping a lot more than I ever probably was after that, even when I was at Grandpa Richard and Grandma Sherry's house. I would say that might have been the second highest time that I just consistently slept for way too many hours a day for months on end. But I think the first highest would definitely be when I was deliberately, like, just hope, October 2021, something like that. I wake up, feel like I have no purpose, and, okay, let's go get something to eat from the fridge, and then immediately go back and pop another pill so I can fast forward another 3 or 4 hours of my life at least.

[01:31:42]
**Bradley:**
And then when I wake up from that, I'm gonna fast forward again because I have nothing to look forward to and I don't know why I'm still here. Um, that was kind of my mindset. So anyway, like we said, 50 years. So we rounded that up. 11.5 years.

[01:31:58]
**Bradley:**
So rounded up. So, dude, if I continue at the pace I have been for probably, probably been at this pace for the last year or so. I think the first time I remember going without Adderall for like, double digit number days, like 10 days, was during my time at Grandpa Richard and Grandma Sherry's house in Branson, Missouri. I can't remember exactly when it was, if it was during the summertime or during the winter. But anyway, I've been exhibiting this probably this same level of overconsumption over the past year.

[01:32:35]
**Bradley:**
Again, not exact, but generally consuming 30 days worth of Adderall in about 20 days. So I have anywhere from, like a week to 2 weeks cold turkey. Just not fun life. So if I continue that pattern from now until I'm 80 years old, 80 years old, I will literally throw away and flush down the drain and bury 12 years of life. Can you imagine sitting on a couch for 12 years?

[01:33:11]
**Bradley:**
Like, just imagine somebody says, "Hey, man, go sit on the couch." Okay, cool. You're not allowed to leave that couch until 12 years... 12 years later. Like, that...

[01:33:20]
**Bradley:**
That's a long freaking time, dude. And so if those, like, 12 years of me being basically MIA or like, just debilitated because I'm having these withdrawal issues along with the, you know, like, accompanying stomach and digestive issues or, you know, just tendencies to easily get sick during these times and not take care of myself, like, if I... If I keep this up, dude, like, can you imagine 12 years of potential memories? Like, memories with your future wife and kids, like, actual experiences. We're not just talking hours, days, weeks, months, like we were talking...

[01:34:02]
**Bradley:**
Imagine that you're getting tapped out for 12 freaking years. Like, 12 years of amazing, like, potentially best time of your life... Experiences that will just never... That just never happen because you allowed yourself to slip into MIA position and, like, you just didn't... You didn't show up, show up for yourself in life like you should have and as a result, you got robbed.

[01:34:36]
**Bradley:**
12 years. 12 years of meaningful interactions and, like, life changing relationships and experiences with your family members and friends that you should have had, that you should have shared with them that they should have had from you. Right. I think that's really the thing that, like, I guess scares me is like, I don't want to rob my closest family members and friends and the people I care about. I don't want to rob them of those experiences or those relationships.

[01:35:14]
**Bradley:**
I don't want to rob myself of them either. But I don't want to rob... I don't want to rob Audrey's future kids of experiencing is, you know, playing with my future kids and all of us hanging out because I chose to allow myself to get stressed out and over consume and then basically put myself in a temporary coma month after month after month. So anyway, I'm done talking about this part. I don't want to be too, like, somber, but I think I need to realize the gravity of the situation and also realize, so here's the bright side, dude.

### Finding a Solution

[01:35:50]
**Bradley:**
Like, the tweak or the change that you need to get all of those 12 years back is, like, super within reach. Like, very, very attainable. It is not some herculean, like, goliath size change or effort you gotta make. Really, what I got for out is just, okay, what are these decision tree, like, forks or, like, patterns in the road where I have been slipping up? Where it's like, okay, I'll give you an example of today.

[01:36:29]
**Bradley:**
So I noticed myself... So I started out today. I did... Well, first off, woke up Laney sent me a text. Like, I had talked to her the previous night.

[01:36:40]
**Bradley:**
She had a foot flood damage at her Fine & Dandy farm with dogs and stuff. And she's like, "Can you just please write me an email that I can send out to my entire email list? And he'll basically say, hey, I have a GoFundMe set up so that people can start contributing because they've been asking how they can help, you know, rebuild the dog's farm." And so I was like, "Yeah, sure, I'll do it." Like, it was a last minute kind of thing, and I did it for free.

[01:37:06]
**Bradley:**
Even though Laney still hasn't paid me for last week's blog post. I'm trying to be empathetic and understanding here, dude. I understand there's a hurricane, but, like, there have been previous times again, but, like, there have been previous times where there are actually 2 distinct times where I scheduled a Zoom call with her and she confirmed, and then she just never showed up to either of those. So I just felt like I just... And then she was, like, very adamant in the morning, like, "I need this by noon."

[01:37:31]
**Bradley:**
Like, "I can you just, like, I know you got client calls. Can you bump this to the front of your priority list? We need to go out now." And I'm just thinking my mind... So I'm going to talk about more than just Adderall here.

[01:37:42]
**Bradley:**
I'm going to talk about some things that make me feel alive and connected with my purpose vs things that make me feel dead inside or detached from my purse. Right, so sorry. This hill is steep. Um, it was just like, rush, rush, rush. Yeah.

[01:38:02]
**Bradley:**
"I need this from you right now." And anyway, I just have not felt like she has really, at least lately, has... Hasn't really been respecting my time or, like, financial considerations or... I don't know what you want to call it, but, like, the fact that she didn't show up to 2 Zoom calls and one of those Zoom calls, like, I was calling her trying to see, hey, what's up? Do we need to reschedule what's going on?

[01:38:30]
**Bradley:**
And, like, an hour and a half later, I get a call from her saying, "Well, there's a bunch of drama with the sister missionary. Sorry." And then she, like, went on to describe in detail for probably an hour after that, all the drama that the sister missionaries have been experiencing. And I'm like, could, like, I didn't say this, but I probably should have just like, "Okay... Like, we all..."

[01:38:53]
**Bradley:**
"Obviously, we both talked last night. Like, I texted you, you text me back. Yeah, let's do Zoom call at 11:00 a.m. or whatever. If you know that you're gonna be late or that you're gonna miss it, could you at least, like, text..."

[01:39:04]
**Bradley:**
"Text me in the first 15 minutes or so so that I don't have to sit there for an hour staring at my own selfie camera, like, staring at my face in my MacBook computer screen, just twiddling my thumbs, waiting for you, like, hoping and expecting that you're gonna show up, but then literally just, like, draining an hour, an hour and a half my day waiting for you while you invest in the sister missionaries gossip and drama instead of, like, showing up for the Zoom call with your ghostwriter that you already committed to, that's actually gonna make you money and give you clarity of thought rather than trading that for the cheap gossip and drama of the sister missionaries that randomly shows up." I don't know, man. It's just...

[01:40:02]
**Bradley:**
There have just been, again, 2 distinct Zoom calls like that where we've been on board, and then there's just no... There's no heads up. It's like, I'm literally sitting there for an hour, and I sent her a message or try to call her after 20, 30 minutes, and it's like, no response. Until way later. And it turns out that she was doing some other random thing that she got distracted by that she prioritized over, like, the time we were supposed to make progress together.

[01:40:32]
**Bradley:**
And so I'm just stuck there twiddling my thumbs. Anyway, I know I'm talking a lot about this, but I just kind of feel frustrated. Like, why are, like, why are you not respecting my time? Or, you know, like, there has been another time where she couldn't or didn't pay me until like, 3 days later, after post was finished, after I sent her the request. And again, I don't know.

[01:41:01]
**Bradley:**
I mean, I'm assuming what that is. It's just literally money problems. Like, she's just too broke to afford this kind of stuff, which is not... It's not that much. I mean, I don't want to be overly critical again.

[01:41:13]
**Bradley:**
Like, I'm the guy with $10 in his bank account, so I shouldn't be talking, but I'm just like, why?

[01:41:23]
**Bradley:**
I don't know. If I sent you a Venmo request and then politely asked, like, "Hey, I know things are hectic out there. Hope you're doing well. Would you mind taking care of the Venmo today when you get a chance?" And then, like, you just...

[01:41:36]
**Bradley:**
You ignore it and you don't do it. And then, like, eventually you call and you say, "Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get around to it. But first, I need you to do something for me for free today. Move your calls." Like, what?

[01:41:49]
**Bradley:**
Like, what the hell kind of mindset that is that? Like, yeah, clear... Clear your calendar.

[01:41:57]
**Bradley:**
Ignore your other calls they have with clients or people or coaches, whatever. I need you to write an email for me today for free to get people to donate to my GoFundMe. And again, I'm probably being way overly critical, but let me just say this way. My work experiences, especially, especially things like this, where I feel like I am putting in so much honest effort. And, like, I'm sure that some percentage of that, maybe 20% or whatever is...

[01:42:34]
**Bradley:**
Is just, like, overthinking and unnecessary stuff, but the remainder of it, like, the majority of this 80% effort, is truly, like...

[01:42:50]
**Bradley:**
Like, I genuinely care and I'm interested, I'm invested, and I actually want to, like, make a difference for you. Right? And then also, just again, I know Laney doesn't have a ton of money, and she was used to paying a broke freelancer girl to write her blog post, which, honestly, her previous freelancers writing was, like, super shitty. Sorry, just really bad. Like, it was not persuasive at all.

[01:43:19]
**Bradley:**
It was not... I guarantee you, it was not converting. And then, like, you have me come on. And, yeah, I'm more expensive, for sure, but I'm writing much more effective content that you actually love, that you even say you want to put into a book one day, and then, like, meanwhile, you kind of, like, randomly stop showing up to these Zoom calls and then, like, stop paying me on time and then also... Then start asking me to do things for free and to clear my schedule and to be patient with you.

[01:43:59]
**Bradley:**
But you're not really patient with me. I'm just, like, I don't know. I don't know, man. I just... I don't want to work with this caliber or your clients anymore.

[01:44:09]
**Bradley:**
Like, I understand, and I am super grateful for my experience working with Laney, and it is possible that I might work with her for a long time. Maybe another 6 months, maybe a year, maybe even beyond that, I have no idea.

### Seeking Higher-Value Opportunities

[01:44:27]
**Bradley:**
But, like, I... To be really plugged into my purpose and, like, I'm making an impact, there needs to be this balance of, like, I'm actually making... Like, I'm charging for the value that I'm delivering it delivering. And it's a mutually beneficial thing where it's, like, the client goes, "Okay, you know... You know, that's definitely..."

[01:44:50]
**Bradley:**
"That's not cheap, but, you know, based on everything you showed me and based on the results, I know we can get together. It is worth it." And then I go, and I... I just feel so much more stoked and invested to work and for that client and, like, get them results when they're like, "Hey, I see the value, and I want to pay you, like, I want to pay you full price for it, or I even want to pay you more. Like, I want to pay you a recurring monthly rate to keep writing for us."

[01:45:20]
**Bradley:**
Right. Whatever it is, I just feel like...

[01:45:24]
**Bradley:**
I just feel like I have and many ways, I've been robbing myself of my own time and my own financial potential. But what I'm just saying is, like, this is the month... Like, this is the month, Bradley. I got to make this money anyway to pay for PGA because I... By, like, October...

[01:45:44]
**Bradley:**
October 27 or, like, October, the end of October, basically, I got to pay $1,050 to PGA because that's my monthly amount, and so I got to make money for that purpose. But, like, really on a more emotionally compelling and, like, desirable level, I gotta start making money so I can, like, really start, like, just being my true self and enjoying living my life again and not having to and not having to, like, grasp at straws or feel like I have to take these sort of low lying fruit opportunities where...

[01:46:34]
**Bradley:**
Where I'm writing what's supposed to be weekly newsletter, and it turns into a newsletter every 2 weeks because Laney's crazy schedule or whatever. And then, like, the initial plan was to deliver, like, high converting copywriting to Laney over the period of a month, and I would earn a $1,000 from that. But it's just... It's dragged on really long, and I even lowered my rate just to, like, accommodate for her and also, you know, just give myself a quick win opportunity and, like, dude, I've been writing these blog posts for 2 months now. Barely only made $500 so far.

[01:47:23]
**Bradley:**
Like, $500 for a 2 month span of work. I know I'm not working on it every day. I understand that. But, like, this is just way too slow and it's just not good enough, especially with the other kind of communication failures. And what I feel, quite frankly, is, I mean, at least on some level, like, either a lack of self awareness or just, like, a disrespect for my time and, you know, the value of what I provide.

[01:47:55]
**Bradley:**
So, again, maybe... Maybe you're listening to this and you're thinking, man, this guy sounds like a total... Like a total dick. Like, he's coming from a very insensitive place. He thinks he's a hotshot.

[01:48:07]
**Bradley:**
And if you do, great, I'm happy to... Happy to evolve and adapt my perspective, but I just want to show these feelings. I think, again, this... This plugs really deeply into... This actually does plug into the Adderall thing, because it's like if I consume my normal daily dose and I channel my attention into my lever moving actions that get the things done for that day, and I actually have, like, specific, well defined goals, aka lighthouse goals with projects, to achieve them.

[01:48:46]
**Bradley:**
And I feel like I'm just steadily moving along, right? Like, we got some steady momentum, like a freight train is rolling then. And I'm also plugged in to, like, with friends and like-minded people. And there's social accountability, there's healthy interactions. I'm not isolated.

[01:49:04]
**Bradley:**
I'm not trying to figure out everything on my own, but I feel like I've got a good support system. And I'm maybe, like, struggling because I'm taking on new challenges, but I'm learning new things and I'm actually delivering, offering value and upgrading my skillset gaining strength and intelligence and again, health, wealth, relationships, as long as those things are on a healthy trajectory, I actually don't feel the need or even, like, the urge or desire to over consume Adderall because it's like, you know, what? Checkpoints for today are done because I, like, correctly channeled my energy into the things that I know matter today. And I don't feel this, like, lonely sense of isolation or, like, detachment from my purpose. Like, I'm not...

[01:49:56]
**Bradley:**
I don't have either the roadmap or the social accountability to achieve my goals. And I'm just spinning my wheels because when I'm left to my own devices, like, when I'm just left on my own, I tend to start out strong, but then very quickly, like, doubt and uncertainty and distractions try to start to creep in, and I try to fill those voyager... Those gaps with, like, research in the form of procrastination.

[01:50:24]
**Bradley:**
And I just don't have... I just don't have, like, basically a mirror or a self reflective device or I don't have anyone to, like, hold my own reflection up to me and call me out on it and basically say, like, "Hey, man, what's up? What's going on?" And that kind of thing. So anyway, that's what I'm saying is you don't want to be stuck in a feedback vacuum, right?

[01:50:56]
**Bradley:**
Because you, whatever group of people you're participating in, you will naturally gravitate towards their actions, beliefs, and values. And, like, if they're winning, if they're repping out sales calls, if they're making new friends, like, odds are you probably will be doing those same things, too. And it will make it much easier to do those things because it's just like, it's just expected. Like, that becomes a status quo. The expectation of, oh, that's a hard thing to do.

[01:51:27]
**Bradley:**
Just gets dropped to the floor because it's like, well, everybody's doing it, and you can clearly see... See, and they can help you do it, too. So, anyway, all I'm trying to say is, I think so PGA will give me a good, like, a solid level up in terms of, like, being able to either... Either leave behind old clients or old, you know, low paying jobs or low paying scenarios that I have reluctantly had to take in the past and just had to deal with, like, the annoyances and stress of those things and just kind of feeling like I'm devalued and overstretched. So, again, PGA will open up opportunities to actually work with clients who have much larger audiences who are actually making money, who are...

[01:52:22]
**Bradley:**
Who don't have money problems, basically, who are not afraid to spend that, but also are, you know, more... More along the lines of, you know, like-minded and, like, competent and aligned with the niche and industry and interests and skills that I want to develop things that I want to learn. So anyway, that's good. That door is gonna open up again. I need to be relentless in my pursuit of not just doing the assignments, but putting myself out there, which I feel like I have...

[01:52:53]
**Bradley:**
Like, I actually sent... I actually replied or sent, like, a Slack messages to 3 of the other new ghostwriters who just joined this week. I sent... I sent, like, 3 messages to random people who kind of had come in interest and they replied and then I replied back. So I've been trying to be more active and I do feel like I am doing that.

### Strategies to Avoid Adderall Overuse

But anyway, so let me just point out real quick, because I want to point out some sort of observations I've had and, like, dangers to avoid so that I don't have to deal with this constant, like, ever so predictable 20 days on, 10 days off cycle going forward. Like, even if I could just get it to, like, 25 days on and then 5 days off this month, that'd be a huge win. Massive win. Right? So here's some things I noticed the past couple days since being back on Adderall.

[01:53:45]
**Bradley:**
Some will be good, some will be bad. These are some things I need to, like, just grab the... Grab the reins and take control of. So if I want to succeed, if I want to get that 12 years of my life back, those relationships and experiences. So, um, number 1.

[01:54:03]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so I'll sometimes I'll have, like, the PGA curriculum open, and I'll be taking notes on a video, for example. And while it's really good to take notes on a video, I think you just have to kind of zoom in and zoom out every now and then and be like, okay, is this module, or is this particular thing that they're teaching me how... How intense, like, how detailed of notes do I got to take? Because, like, you should be taking notes, it's good. But if you go...

[01:54:33]
**Bradley:**
If you go overboard and you try to, especially, like, especially when you're in learning mode on Adderall and you're trying to write down, like, every single idea that makes an impression in your mind, like, you're... You're not only going to spend a ton of time typing that down and then pausing video and then skipping back 15 seconds, 10, like, over and over again to replay what you missed, but you're also going to be reformatting and, like, rewriting those bullet points that you wrote out. And anyway, there's just like, there's a lot of downstream... A lot of downstream, like, almost invisible consequences where if you open the door to one thing, that opens the next door to the next thing, and then next... And next.

[01:55:16]
**Bradley:**
So, anyway, just evaluate, okay, for this module I'm working on, what do I need to do? Like, what do I really need to take deeper notes? What's the best way to engage with this material?

[01:55:30]
**Bradley:**
And, like, let me step back into the mind of my, like, high school self, also my college self. I feel like my freshman year, especially freshman year college self, very savage in terms of, like, I was my, my switch that I needed to turn on from no B's to, all of a sudden, full mode B's was very easily triggered. So it was like, if I needed, if I got 30 minutes to write this whole essay, I'm just gonna let my fingers fly. I'm just gonna say whatever the heck I want, and it's just much easier to get in that mode. So, anyway, I would just look at these modules and be like, cool, cool.

[01:56:07]
**Bradley:**
This is here for me to learn, but the goal is to, like, just get a, get a first draft understanding of this and move on, right? I'm not trying to, like, rewrite these modules as a book and preserve them for future generations. Like, that's why the modules exist in the first place. That's what they are. But me, I'm just gonna take a quick, like, first draft kind of basic level layer of notes if I have to, right?

[01:56:33]
**Bradley:**
I'm going to go into B's mode. How much of this can I either avoid doing or just sort of skim forward and skip to the actions, which is where the real learning happens, right? Again, that's just a mindfulness thing. Zoom in, zoom out. Another thing I noticed is so, well, okay, writing Laney's writing Laney's free email today.

[01:56:58]
**Bradley:**
I mean, I feel good that I did it. I don't feel good that I did it. At the same time, I was like, what? I just sunk, like, a solid, probably 2, maybe even 3 hours, because the night before, I braindumped to a voice note and went on a walk. And then that day, I, like, I made a bunch of edits because I wanted it to be good.

[01:57:20]
**Bradley:**
I probably sunk, like, 2 or 3 hours into writing that dang email on a breakneck pace, like, last minute and then getting paid nothing for it, obviously. And then not only that, but, like, also knowing that, hey, I'm probably not even gonna get paid for the previous blog post. I wrote. So, like, why am I, why am I out of the goodness of my heart? I get that.

[01:57:42]
**Bradley:**
But, like, why am I putting so much effort into trying to create awesome, solid content that actually converts and, like, gets Lanny's target audience to donate to her and take action when, again, I'm not even getting paid for this, and I'm being expected to be, like, a freelancer sort of on call person all the time, which is not who I am. So I just feel like a lot of life sucked out of me, and, like, I'm not connecting with my purpose when those things get in the way. And I felt like that really threw off my morning. It totally threw off my morning. Um, because then I went into the, the onboarding call with Jamie, and I hadn't really written down a list of questions to ask her, which I normally would, and the call still went fine.

[01:58:29]
**Bradley:**
But then it's like, after that call, I just felt so exhausted because I'd written that blog post, and then it was just so much easier to get distracted, and I didn't really, it didn't click in my brain, like, okay, what is next? Lever moving action step to take you from here, right? So that through my... That threw my day off. That's something to keep in mind or just notice, avoid those situations.

[01:58:50]
**Bradley:**
You can also, if you can, batch certain tasks, that's great, right? Rather than context switching. I know they talk about this in PGA a lot.

[01:59:02]
**Bradley:**
Think what else, man, it's 2:13. Dad's probably gonna be pissed at me if I, if he's awake. Oh, well. Oh, well.

[01:59:21]
**Bradley:**
Anyway, let's see. What else? What else? Okay. There was another sort of decision point or inflection point where, again, I think I was getting a little bit distracted, and I...

[01:59:33]
**Bradley:**
And again, I was trying to take, I was trying to take notes on this thing, like this module zero thing, but then I got distracted because I was like, well, it would be really nice to have live captions for this video so I could actually read along to it because I'm not sure I'm, like, hearing what Cole is actually saying. And then I went off and for, like, 20 minutes, tried to find a Google Chrome extension that was for live captions, and then that didn't work out. Right. And so I guess there are all these, like, little mini kind of disturbances or annoyances or things that come up where I'm like, ah, I just want to, like, this is annoying me. I want to fix it.

[02:00:11]
**Bradley:**
I want to get live captions or whatever. But then once you make the decision to disengage your attention from the actual important task at hand and go try to find that quick little... That quick little fix that doesn't really matter at the end of the day. Like, that's when you derail yourself, right? Another example is...

[02:00:31]
**Bradley:**
So if I was to do that scenario again, I would have just been like, cool, I'll research live captions later. Like, before I'm going to bed. But for right now, let's just bust through this video, right? That's attitude I'd have. That's the thing, too.

[02:00:43]
**Bradley:**
It's not just... It's not just getting better at being mindful. It's like having a savage attitude going into it and then, like, maintaining that. Right? Gotta get yourself in the zone by reframing.

[02:00:56]
**Bradley:**
So let's see what else. Okay. Another thing, I tried, like, later in the day, I tried to go back, and I resumed watching that video by Cole and I resumed taking notes, but I also had, like, sort of previously... Previously started... Like, I created my account for...

[02:01:17]
**Bradley:**
For Dan Koe's software called Kortex. K o r t e x. Kortex. So I created my account, and then I, like, kind of pulled open a new tab where it had the YouTube video where Dan Koe walks you through, basically, like, the onboarding and features of Kortex. And so I was like, oh, man.

[02:01:36]
**Bradley:**
Like, this could really organize my writing. Why don't I watch this now and then? Anyway, I just way too easily allowed myself to, like, jump into that without thinking ahead of time. Like, okay, what's this gonna cost me to do this now? When in reality, if I just will time block it for a different time, I'll be able to still get the same benefits out of Kortex.

[02:02:02]
**Bradley:**
But I'll preserve my super valuable attention that I should be using to smash out my leper moving actions right now. Because that leads to so much more fulfillment and purpose and, like, possibility curve actualization of your potential now, right? Instead of just feeling like you're getting deluded because you're... Because you have to, you have a million different tabs open at once. And each activity that you're doing in that tab is, like, in the middle, you're kind of halfway done with something and you just want to...

You're basically opening a bunch of new loops. So the question just becomes, okay, I definitely want to get to Kortex. So this is how I do it. I'd say I definitely want to get to Kortex. So let's create a folder in my Arc browser.

[02:02:52]
**Bradley:**
Let's throw all the Kortex tabs that I currently have open in there. I'm not going to look at them right now until like, I'm going to set a rule for myself. I will not open those, any Kortex tab or any Kortex email or any Dan Koe content at all until I'm literally finished with module zero of PGA. Until I finished the video, checked it off the list. And again, as an added incentive, if I want to get to Kortex faster, well, maybe I should skip out on taking such detailed notes and just try to get the gist of it right.

[02:03:30]
**Bradley:**
Use that as an ascent, an incentive, basically delay gratification. Here's the thing, dude. Like anytime that something like that comes in your mind, something that either like, it bothers you, it feels like an itch, like, oh, I should add this live captions extension or, oh, man, I just created a Kortex account. I should, you know, at least get somewhat familiar with how that works. Whatever.

[02:03:52]
**Bradley:**
Like whatever open loop is jumping out at you. What you could do, you could either add it to your thought stream list, like, that's been pretty effective, or you could basically compartmentalize it, right? Like you put it in a bin and then you stuff that bin somewhere where you're not going to see it until later on, which will be the right time, right? So an example of this is, okay, I have all these Kortex tabs open. Let's batch them all together.

[02:04:20]
**Bradley:**
Let's just grab them all together and toss them into a new folder labeled Kortex. And then I'll put that folder in a certain area within my Arc browser where I know it's there. I'm not going to forget about it, but I'm not tempted to open it up or look at it and it's basically like it's locked up, it's safe, it's in its place.

[02:04:47]
**Bradley:**
But like that loop is effectively like partially closed. It's almost like it's stitched closed for now until I'm ready to come back to it, right? So if there's some way to like batch or group or like compartmentalize, throw all these, all these sort of whatever tabs that are trying to open a loop in your brain, throw them all into one place, whether that's a folder or whatever, and then put it just out of sight and out of mind enough that it's not going to come back and rob you of your attention for the rest of the day, but you feel safe and sound knowing that you put it in a safe place where like you're familiar enough to come back to it and find it when the time's right and you can even again, I would front load this as an incentive. I'd be like, okay, you know what? I really want to get to Kortex.

[02:05:39]
**Bradley:**
That's great. So let me make that a reward.

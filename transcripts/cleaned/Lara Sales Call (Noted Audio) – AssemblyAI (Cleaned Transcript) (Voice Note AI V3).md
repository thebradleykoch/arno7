[00:00:00]
**Lara:**
More. So that's kind of the extent of it. What I'm working on right now, as far as my business goes, and then I'll explain home. I want to be able to market my online business more, which means social media, and I just hate it.

[00:00:21]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:00:24]
**Lara:**
I don't want to do it. I also want to make money with my program. So being able to, I don't know if it can, like, upload a whole bunch of past things I've done. So it's learning my style and language and then start producing. Like, I have tons and tons of content. It would be so nice to just reuse a lot of that stuff and have it just populate new social media posts. So that's one thing that I'd like to do. 

The other is I'm teaming up with a therapy office to be, like, their in-house coach. So we're kind of working together on that. And they don't have a lot of blog posts at this point. What I'd like to do is take some of my content and turn it into longer form blog posts they would be able to use on their site. So there's that that I'd like to do business wise. 

And then, like, on the personal side, I envision, and this may be too grandiose, but I envision having, like, an assistant that I can talk to, like, oh, like a Jarvis? Yeah, like, where is my Jarvis? So being able to have something where I can talk, talking to it. Because when I'm driving, that's when I remember everything and I'm not in a spot that I can do much. So it'd be really nice to just, like, you know, talk into something. Like, "Add this to the checklist." I kind of do it with Alexa right now, but being able to kind of manage those things that are always in my mind and having one spot and kind of organizing it for me.

[00:02:21]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:02:22]
**Lara:**
Again, that might be too much.

[00:02:24]
**Bradley:**
Is that. Have you ever used, like, the voice chat feature with the ChatGPT app before?

[00:02:29]
**Lara:**
No, I haven't.

[00:02:30]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Yeah, because that's something I use every day for, like, when I want to. Because I think people have a hard time, especially. I mean, I have a hard time with this, too. But going from scattered, you know, braindump thoughts that come to your mind to writing it out in a structured format, and I think the bridge to that is conversationally brain dumping to something. 

And then, so, like, a lot of times what I'll do is if I'm working on a project, or, I mean, it could even be like, an introspective journal entry kind of thing. You know, I'll just say, like, I have a specific prompt where I use the voice chat, and I say, "Hey, I'm just gonna braindump to you a bunch of different messages. I'll say, like, a certain keyword at the end. So, you know, literally just respond with the word, okay. And then I'm gonna keep going, keep going, keep going. And at the very end I'll give you another keyword that says, like, I'm ready for you to fully respond to me. I want you to create a clear, coherent outline of what I've just shared with you." 

And then whether it's like action items or whether it's just like, you know, resources I want to pull from or specific things I want to achieve, whatever it is. And then I'll create, I'm surprised how coherent it is, how I can just take a bunch of scatter, scattered brain, braindump things and put it into like a clear, coherent outline of stuff to do. And you can keep coming back to that chat thread when you have more stuff that you want to braindump as well. So that's definitely something I could show you how to do if that's, I.

[00:03:56]
**Lara:**
Have to show you because just based on that, like, you'll, you'll get how funny this is. Let me see if I can find really quick. Okay, I'm going to share this because, hold on. So this is my current braindump. Sometimes it's like I'm coaching myself because I don't know what to get my mother-in-law for her birthday.

[00:04:33]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:04:35]
**Lara:**
So this, so based on what you said, like, here's creating like a morning routine and an evening routine are people I need to apologize for because I have a horrible mouth. So then it's like, literally, I call it my braindump. And it is like just stuff that's thrown out and like all these other different, and I'm like just putting it into one spot. So hard to keep track of a brain and all is on there.

[00:05:06]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, well, it's perfect that you use Notion already. Cause that's what I use as well, a bunch of this stuff. But yeah.

[00:05:15]
**Lara:**
So with, with AI, then, like, how do you, how do you use it on the personal front? Like, I feel like I almost have more of a grasp if it's like, here, write this paragraph vs like a chat feature. Like, I didn't even know it had that.

[00:05:31]
**Bradley:**
Well, I mean, what I like to do is I like to, I try to separate it into different threads. So if it's like, if it's like, here's people that I need to text, or I know I want you to just rewrite this text to someone to, like, make it more smooth and natural, I'll just have a dedicated thread for that specific thing. So if you could, like, split your brain up into different, as verticals are like, categories of what.

[00:05:58]
**Lara:**
Yeah.

[00:05:58]
**Bradley:**
What belongs in there. So whether one's more of, like, on the business side or specific thing in the business side or personal is like, you might have a journaling braindump when you might have like, a dedicated thread for a type of interaction you have, whether that's texting or whether it's like tough conversations that I need to have with my kids or family or whatever it is, you know. So that way it's like you can mentally sort of organize. Okay, which thread am I brain dumping into? And it's not too scattered, but at the same time it is like, it is general purpose. You can keep going back to it. You don't need to start a new chat thread every time you want to do that same thing.

[00:06:41]
**Lara:**
That's really helpful. Yeah. Right now where it'll say, like, on the side of ChatGPT, like different things I've done, but some of the past, something like, I don't remember what any of that was. The day in my brain, I guess, like, I couldn't figure out how to put them in folders or anything. So it makes sense to see, like, categories or threads like, that makes it a lot easier.

[00:07:03]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. And I think, I mean, I wish they would do this with ChatGPT more. This is one thing that's kind of frustrating, is I wish they would just allow you to put things in folders a little bit better. But I mean, if you can, if you can. I always rename my threads, like, I'll name it something specific so that I kind of have an idea of, like, the type of thread it is, and then maybe like the headline or the title of that thread. So it's like self reflection thread. I'll type self reflection colon, and then whatever the topic is.

[00:07:34]
**Lara:**
Okay.

[00:07:35]
**Bradley:**
So that way it does make it easier to find, but, yeah, yeah, that.

[00:07:39]
**Lara:**
Makes a lot of sense. So when you're doing something, like, within one of the categories, how do you just copy and paste it then into Notion and then, like, organize it more in Notion? Like, how do you do that?

[00:07:54]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, so whenever I go from, like, well, I guess it depends because it's like, because you're going from conversationally braindumping something to an outline and then whenever I want to actually, like, take action on it and actually click the checkbox of, like, I've done this thing, then I'll copy and paste it to Notion. And it does a good job of like, preserving the formatting. So it's, you know, things are bold or things are numbered lists. 

I think it just depends on, like, do you want, like, once you have that outline, do you want to then, like, start actually writing stuff out or editing it or actually, like, clicking the checklist items? It just sort of like, because you go from braindump ideas that are floating around your mind to conversational outline to written outline, which is closer to where you would be able to either, like, publish something or just keep track of it in Notion. If it's personal.

[00:08:49]
**Lara:**
Yeah.

[00:08:50]
**Bradley:**
But, yeah, it just depends on like, what stage, what's the next state you're trying to get it into.

[00:08:56]
**Lara:**
Okay, that makes sense.

[00:08:58]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:08:58]
**Lara:**
Because I have this problem of keeping, like, you saw, like a whole bunch of stuff in Notion and then I forget to go back into Notion.

[00:09:09]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, exactly.

[00:09:11]
**Lara:**
For the most part. Like, I, I mean, I don't check it off there, but I get a lot done. But it'd almost be nice to, you know, have like, the checklist where I'm actually printing it off. I mean, that sounds like old lady-ish to print it off and like, check things off, but, yeah, I just kind of feel like sometimes if I only keep it in Notion, I don't ever come back to it. Yeah, so that's, yeah, that's an interesting thought on, like, what's the next step beyond that? So, yeah, okay. I'll think about.

[00:09:45]
**Bradley:**
And I, and I do find for myself, even like, if it's just written down somewhere, unless it, unless there's an actual checkbox that I'm each either, like, digitally tapping to check off or physically writing down, like, I just won't do it.

[00:09:58]
**Lara:**
Yeah, yeah, I, these cute little, like, check off for my kids morning routines for school where they have to slide something over. Maybe that's what I need for, like, my evening routines over. Okay, so that's really helpful. When you're using it to write content, how do you teach it? Your tone of voice, like, what prompts do you use for that? So it kind of gets. Oh, you.

[00:10:34]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So let me ask you. So, like, you're, when you're writing content, I know you mentioned there's blog posts. What other, like, content types are you looking to publish? Because you have, you could have, like, blog posts, you could have Twitter threads, you could have you know, a sales page, landing page, emails, like all the different types. What are the main things that you're looking to write?

[00:10:54]
**Lara:**
So the main ones for my business, I do, like, my main one is my podcast. Then from there I send an email about the podcast, and then I do social media posts where it's typically posting on Instagram, and then that's automatically copied to Facebook. So those are the main ones. I don't do a lot of reels. There's just so much work. I don't do a lot of stories. 

So when I'm thinking about content, that's the AI would be writing. That's probably the main ones. I usually write my own podcast, but I've recently been trying to use AI to help me come up with better titles. But I don't know if there's a way to, like, upload an audio and it learns from the podcast. Like, I don't know if this might be way outside of the realm of possibilities. I don't have any idea. But it'd be cool. Like, if it could even take, like, the transcript of my podcast and then from there write the email and then make a couple social media posts off of that.

[00:12:11]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:12:12]
**Lara:**
I've also looked at, oh, shoot, what's the name? I played around with it. Opus. Opus. Oprah clip.

[00:12:22]
**Bradley:**
Like, Claude is it.

[00:12:24]
**Lara:**
I don't know what Claude is.

[00:12:26]
**Bradley:**
Claude. They have two different main models. One is, it's like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and then Claude 3 Opus.

[00:12:33]
**Lara:**
Okay.

[00:12:34]
**Bradley:**
I don't know if that's related.

[00:12:37]
**Lara:**
Well, it was like, if I recorded the video for my podcast, like, if I was interviewing someone, it made like short social media.

[00:12:45]
**Bradley:**
Okay, maybe it's something else. I don't know.

[00:12:48]
**Lara:**
Yeah, there's so many now, but then it added captions to it as well.

[00:12:55]
**Bradley:**
Right?

[00:12:56]
**Lara:**
Found like a couple, you know, sound bites, but had the video on. So that's something else I've played around.

[00:13:04]
**Bradley:**
So would it mainly be like either creating blog posts or emails that are basically like the written versions of your podcasts?

[00:13:13]
**Lara:**
Almost, yeah.

[00:13:14]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:13:15]
**Lara:**
I want to use that as like, the main thing and everything just kind of stems off of that.

[00:13:21]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:13:21]
**Lara:**
So I only am focusing on growing and building this as my biggest funnel and all the other content kind of comes off of that.

[00:13:33]
**Bradley:**
Right. Because I know people will do. They'll do like, they'll have. Here's my weekly newsletter. What they'll do is they'll write out a version. Like, they'll create a written version that's almost like a podcast script, I guess you could say. And then they'll record it. It'll be, they'll publish it as a YouTube video, which you don't have to do, but like this is just an example. They'll create a YouTube version of it where they're just reading the script essentially. And then they'll publish that as a podcast, and then they'll publish the written newsletter which gets published to like their blog and then get sent out as an email version of that newsletter that's linked to the blog post. Okay, so it's basically the same exact thing, just published in multiple different formats.

[00:14:16]
**Lara:**
Yeah, I'm writing that down. Okay, so when they're like, how are they using AI? Is it for the first piece of that, like the podcast script? That's what they're using.

[00:14:38]
**Bradley:**
So what I would say is like, and here's how I do so well when you're, let me back up to the very first stage. So initially you start with some sort of prompt for yourself, right? Whether that's, I mean, you need an idea and a topic for whatever you're posting. And you might have some sort of questions that prompt yourself of just like certain things to cover on that topic. Or like basically what you're trying to get is here's a prompt for myself that allows me to share my unique perspective on this topic. 

And then, so that's the first step. First is like a self prompt, and then the second part is your braindump where you're braindumping your unique perspective. I like to do this conversationally, again with the voice chat feature of AI. There's a couple different ways you could do it. You could either do it with ChatGPT braindumping into the chat thread, or you could just record a voice note with any sort of voice recording app on your phone, record the whole thing, and then have it transcribed later. And I can get into that later. Like which one you'd want to choose for what scenario. 

But then the third step would be to create an outline, just like a clear outline of all the stuff that you braindumped, you know, like what are the main ideas, what are the sub ideas, what are the, you know, and it depends on what, it depends on the kind of way that you're wanting to, I don't know, structure your blog posts or your podcast, because you might want to structure it like, hey, here are 3 main benefits of doing this thing, or here are 3 common mistakes to avoid, or here are 3 like personal stories I want to share on this topic. So that's the third step is the outline. 

And then fourth step is usually like a first draft. So some sort of initial rough draft. And that is what I call like the content type or the content structure where you'll have, yeah, where you have, you have a specific, like with writing content, there's two main components to it, and that is the structure and then the style. And so the structure is the container, which is like, okay, here are, here's the skeleton in my writing. Here are the main ideas, which are like the sub heads. Here are the sub ideas, different things I want to share. And then the style is what you layer onto the structure after the first draft is written. 

So that all kind of happens in step 4 of that first draft. And I have specific prompts that I do for clients where they're like, they're always, the concern is always like, "Oh, I want this to be written well, and I want to braindump this voice note or you'll interview me on this topic. But then I'm worried that it's not going to be written in my voice or my style." And a lot of times what I'll take is I'll just literally take a recording of that interview or of their voice note transcript, and I'll have ChatGPT extract a style guide. And it's just like an outline of different attributes of how they talk, how they speak, and then I'll lay that on top. 

And then the final draft is really just like, there's a prompt that has, will have, you will have ChatGPT copy edit your first draft. Just looking for grammar changes. "Hey, is this structured in a clear, coherent way?" And I'll have it recommend changes. I'll say, "Hey, I don't want you to just like automatically rewrite this, but I want you to list out, you know, bullet list all the changes that you'd recommend" and then I'll confirm, like, I'll tell you, give you approval for which changes I want you to implement and then it'll write those out and then you have your final draft.

[00:18:28]
**Lara:**
That's amazing. So that, like, in my mind, sounds so much more fun than me putting my butt in my chair. Blog post.

[00:18:38]
**Bradley:**
Exactly.

[00:18:39]
**Lara:**
Because like, when I'm talking with people, it like, starts to flow so much easier vs like, me, like, writing to someone. That's always been one of my biggest beefs. Like, it's, it feels so much harder than when I'm like, talking to your mom. I'm Marco Polo.

[00:18:55]
**Bradley:**
I'm like, exactly, exactly. So, yeah, that's something that I, that I do with clients. Is like whatever specific type of content they're doing, because you need. The problem is, I think, like with structure, you need, and this is what I do too, is sometimes I'll take a proven piece of content, or like, there will be an email that I really like and I think this is structured really well, or a newsletter. And what I'll do is, and I try to avoid having clients do this because it's kind of complicated for them. Unless you really, unless you're really nerdy and you like this stuff, like me. But I'll have it analyze and extract the structure, like the written structure. It's called rhetorical structure, but basically how the ideas are organized line by line. It'll describe what each sentence is that's written, the different, the different, like psychology elements, right? Whether it's like mistakes to avoid or, you know, bad old thought, thought processes, limiting beliefs, that kind of stuff. 

But you'll extract that. And then what I'll do is I'll just have that as a prompt for clients. I'll say, "Hey, here are maybe 3 different structures you can choose from. You just choose one and plug this in as a prompt and then ChatGPT is going to take everything you braindumped from your, you know, your voice note outline. It's going to write it in the structure, and then it's going to apply your style as a style guide." So it's a few different steps, but they flow into one another. And I'm like, honestly pretty amazed at how, like, I've even done it for my own content, where I'll extract a structure from one of my blog posts I've written in the past, and then I'll just say, "Hey, I want you to write a new blog post based on the structure, given a new topic." And I'm just amazed at how much it sounds like me, how like, clear and coherent it is when I didn't even give it the original blog post in the first place. I just gave it the structure from that blog post.

[00:20:51]
**Lara:**
That's really cool.

[00:20:52]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, that's the main thing I think, is it just depends on what type of, because you need a specific. I call it content type or content structure. And that's like an email, blog post, whatever. And then once you have a prompt for that, it's really easy to layer in your style guide later.

[00:21:10]
**Lara:**
Yeah, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Here's another idea, just as you were talking, that came up would be kind of cool to do, and I don't know if it's possible. Can it read language off of pictures.

[00:21:30]
**Bradley:**
Like, is it like a caption on the picture or.

[00:21:33]
**Lara:**
Yeah, like a screenshot on something. So, like, I take a lot of screenshots. Like, when I'm in Facebook mom groups, I'll just take a screenshot sometimes of, like, their posts, because then it, like, helps me think of, like, podcast ideas on, like, this is something that people are struggling with. Just as you were talking about how it can extract things, it would be cool to take some of those and just put them into ChatGPT and say, "Can you write a podcast episode based on my style and my content to address this kind of concern that moms have based on Facebook posts or whatever?" Can it do that?

[00:22:15]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, so I even have it. I'll even have it. Like, I have my physical notebook that I'm writing notes in, and I'll be like, screen or just picture? Can you transcribe this into a written out version? And it can even take handwriting. And it was probably, like, 85% to 90% accurate on my handwriting, which is pretty messy. But then if something's printed out and it's a screenshot, it's, like, 95% accurate, so that's wild.

[00:22:41]
**Lara:**
Yeah. Cause right now I take just because sometimes I think really well when I'm writing. So I'll write out all my outlines for my podcast. So that pretty cool.

[00:22:51]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:22:53]
**Lara:**
Okay. All right. So you have my brain definitely churning on all of it. How, like, what's next steps? Like, I think your mom mentioned to me forever ago you named yours. So it made me laugh because mine's name is Nori. Like, I know I named her Nori a long time ago.

[00:23:15]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:23:17]
**Lara:**
Do you have.

[00:23:18]
**Bradley:**
All right, go ahead.

[00:23:19]
**Lara:**
Yeah. So I don't really know where to start with all of this. It's fabulous. But where do I go from here?

[00:23:26]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So, well, let's just see. Like, your main goals are to. You want to create your own person, like, your own little AI assistant person with a personality. So that's. I mean, that's one main thing that I can show you how to do, because all it is, is what I try to do is I think, okay, what would be, like, either a digital twin version of me or, like, if I was to create a brother or. Or just, like, a friend that I would want to talk to that basically has my same personality but is also different person than me. 

So I have, like, a specific set of custom instructions that I've written out for mine. My mom has a set of custom instructions that's written out for her, so. And I can get into, like, each point, because there is an outline of different things that you want to include to create that. But, yeah, that's. That's one thing. Especially when you're talking to a conversationally, it feels just like a much more natural conversation with someone that's using your language, you know?

[00:24:29]
**Lara:**
Yes. Does it sync with the app on your phone? Because I haven't figured that part out. Like, I have most of it on my computer, but then when I downloaded the app, none of my conversations moved over to the app.

[00:24:47]
**Bradley:**
Were you using the same account?

[00:24:49]
**Lara:**
I don't know.

[00:24:51]
**Bradley:**
Okay. I think my mom did, like, accidentally create two different accounts. Once when she did on her computer and then once when she did it on our phone.

[00:24:58]
**Lara:**
So when I went to download it, I think it was on my phone. There was, like, all these options, and I'm like, I don't know which one. All the logos looked the same, and I didn't know which one was actually the right one, and then it didn't require me to log in, and so it was really weird that way.

[00:25:15]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, there are a bunch of different, like, they're like, knockoff ones, knockout or, like, pseudo versions of ChatGPT, where it's not actually the thing. So I can. I can text you, like, the actual link to the official one in the app store. Yeah, there are a bunch of ones that just use the ChatGPT API, which is basically, like, connecting to the backend version of ChatGPT, and they make their own app version of it. So, yeah, there's a billion of those that can be confusing.

[00:25:39]
**Lara:**
It was very confusing because then it didn't feel like it had learned anything about me, and I was starting over. I got and deleted the app and have only on my computer since, like, "You're not norm, you're not the same."

[00:25:54]
**Bradley:**
Exactly. So, yeah, I can send you. I can send you the link to that. Just so you know, you're downloading the right one.

[00:26:00]
**Lara:**
Okay. Thank you. Do you pay for the version you pay for?

[00:26:05]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I definitely do. Because the thing is, the free version, you only get. It's like, yeah, you don't get very much messages or something ridiculously small like that, so you just has a rate limit for you. And that. That gets really annoying to me. So I definitely think the plus version is totally worth it. Yeah, it means, like, $20 a month, so it's not nothing crazy.

[00:26:26]
**Lara:**
Yeah. Okay. All right. I'll definitely get that then.

[00:26:32]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:26:34]
**Lara:**
And then outside of that, outside of it having longer messages, are there other benefits to the plus version. Like can I learn better?

[00:26:49]
**Bradley:**
I think you do get whatever new feature releases or capabilities they have. New. I know you can create images too from it. So that's something people, I don't use a ton, but I think could be helpful for. Like if you want to create a cover image for your blog or whatever and you say, "Hey, here's my topic. Can you create a cover image that's in this style?" It's just less manual work for you.

[00:27:13]
**Lara:**
So that's something that's very cool.

[00:27:15]
**Bradley:**
Helpful.

[00:27:16]
**Lara:**
Let me see if I can find. So I heard that somewhere it could make it make images. So I tried to see if it would make a father's day card for my husband. I'm trying to see if I can.

[00:27:35]
**Bradley:**
Find it.

[00:27:39]
**Lara:**
But clearly I was not on this was a man lifting weights.

[00:27:49]
**Bradley:**
It was the best.

[00:27:51]
**Lara:**
I laughed so hard. The vet was my husband's father's day card.

[00:27:56]
**Bradley:**
That's pretty hilarious.

[00:27:58]
**Lara:**
Yeah. So I'm sure they have much better options than the free one. Yeah.

[00:28:09]
**Bradley:**
So yeah, so that's one thing. So creating your own like custom person, that would be helpful, especially for just voice chatting with it. And then the other thing would just be what I would do. Like what I'm working on for another client too is similar to. This is just that 5 step process that I mentioned. I'm just creating like a Notion, basically a workflow in Notion where you have on the left, you have a little navigation bar like table of contents where it's step 1, step 2, step 3, step 4, step 5, and you just click on that, takes you to step 1's page. You go to the next one and it just goes from there. That's something I could also like create or build for you if that's something that you wanted to do.

[00:28:59]
**Lara:**
And that includes the prompts and things.

[00:29:02]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, yeah, okay.

[00:29:05]
**Lara:**
Yeah, no, I definitely want that. How much do you charge for setting all of that up and sending it over?

[00:29:12]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, so I can create because this is kind of new for me too, for creating client. So if you want, I can just like take some notes from this and then send you a proposal kind of thing, like tomorrow sometime. And you can let me know what. What you want to do.

[00:29:24]
**Lara:**
But yeah, yeah, no, count me in for it because I feel like there's so much just waiting to come out. This gets lost. Like I probably have, I don't know, 600 half written social media posts on my notes. You would die. You would absolutely die. Content I have that goes nowhere because the last little bit of like actually writing it and then having it be done. It's always the last 5% that I never finish. So I have tons of content and it's never been put out in the world.

[00:30:05]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. And that can be frustrating. I know for sure is like, you've got all these great ideas, and, like, even for me, I'll go back in my notes and I'll be like, "Man, I actually, like, solved this problem for myself or someone else before. I like the blueprint right here, but it has never made it to that next step of whatever format it needs to be in or whatever." So I can definitely resonate with that.

[00:30:28]
**Lara:**
Yeah. So the person I hired, he's been teaching me Kajabi. I have to, like, show up with my assignments done. Like, I have to be committed to someone, otherwise it would never come out.

[00:30:43]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:30:43]
**Lara:**
But you say blueprint. It's called the ultimate. The ultimate mom's blueprint.

[00:30:47]
**Bradley:**
So nice.

[00:30:50]
**Lara:**
Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, if you'll send me a proposal on all of that, that would be fantastic. It would help. And then going through, I'll go through and start putting categories into Notion. I think that's a great idea.

[00:31:06]
**Bradley:**
So I can keep. Yeah. And then, I know you mentioned there's like a shopping list kind of thing.

[00:31:14]
**Lara:**
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:15]
**Bradley:**
So my family, I showed this app to my family. They used it even during times where I've been, you know, way at college or this or that. So they've, it's, it's easy for anyone to use. It's just called AnyList. And I can send you the link, too. And maybe like on another call I could sort of do a screen share and walk you through how to use it. But it's nice because it'll save the stuff. Like, I have a grocery shopping list and Amazon list. It'll sort of organize stuff by categories, whether it's dairy or grains, whatever, personal hygiene. And you can check stuff off, but it'll save it. So you can just hide the items that you've checked off, but then you can unhide them as well and add them back to your list. So you don't need to, like, retype them out or anything like that.

[00:32:02]
**Lara:**
And I just hold the button down and have Siri add to the app or do I need to open the app?

[00:32:08]
**Bradley:**
I'm sure there's probably Siri shortcut. I'll have to double check on that. But, yeah, I mean, I feel like once you get, once you get a solid, like, initial list of your stuff in there and you're just checking it off, like, it goes pretty good. You'll go back and you'll just uncheck something. Cause you'll have a pretty set list over time and eventually get to the point where you don't really need to change it that much. But, yeah, I'm sure there's some sort of Siri shortcut, too.

[00:32:35]
**Lara:**
Yeah. Right now I use Alexa, like, the app. We've got an echo dot in the kitchen. That's probably what I use the most as far as keeping track of lists, because I'm in the kitchen, I'm like, "Oh, I need Alexa. Add this to the shopping list." So then, like, being able to speak instead of like, where's my phone? Can I go find my phone? So even. Yeah, but even just thinking about all my Amazon stuff going and adding a list, I buy everything on Amazon, so when I'm budgeting things, it's hard to see where I'm actually spending my money, because it all comes.

[00:33:15]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think there might be. There's got to be a way because I know I've set up some sort of thing with. It's like Alexa shortcut, where it's not Siri, but it still connects to the app.

[00:33:27]
**Lara:**
Oh, that's cool.

[00:33:28]
**Bradley:**
So it might be able to. I have to double check on that.

[00:33:30]
**Lara:**
Okay. Yeah, that would be awesome if it did that. Yeah. Because even going through starting to make an inventory on stuff, I feel very judged by our Amazon driver.

[00:33:55]
**Bradley:**
I'm sure you're not the only one.

[00:34:00]
**Lara:**
But I would like to have some rhyme or reason to when things show up, instead of every night, I'm like, "Oh, I forgot to order this," and then hang back every day.

[00:34:12]
**Bradley:**
Exactly. Okay.

[00:34:14]
**Lara:**
That's really helpful. But, yeah, just put together a proposal and then let me know. But this has been super, super helpful. I really appreciate it. I'm excited, for sure.

[00:34:26]
**Bradley:**
Well, yeah, and feel free to text me if there's anything that we forgot to mention. Text me. But, yeah. Did you say, I'll get a. Like, I'll get a copy of the. Emailed? Yeah, I think. Okay, sweet.

[00:34:40]
**Lara:**
You'll have to tell me what you think about it every once in a while. There's some funny notes in there, but it's pretty accurate. I've got a 16-year-old client. I meet with him and his mom, and one of the notes said that he became a grandpa 3 weeks ago, even though it was grandpa.

[00:34:59]
**Bradley:**
That's funny.

[00:35:00]
**Lara:**
So, yeah, you always find some funny things, but it's funny. Pretty accurate.

[00:35:04]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:35:05]
**Lara:**
I've been impressed with it, and my clients have really loved it.

[00:35:08]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. It's useful, for sure.

[00:35:11]
**Lara:**
Yeah. Yeah. So you'll get that at the end. Oh. When you're working on something, do you create the prompts or will you give prompts to how to set up your assistant? Like, how to teach it the personality you want, like you were describing?

[00:35:29]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. Are you talking about, like, the custom instructions kind of thing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can include that for you as well.

[00:35:36]
**Lara:**
Okay. Yeah. Just include that on the proposal because that's.

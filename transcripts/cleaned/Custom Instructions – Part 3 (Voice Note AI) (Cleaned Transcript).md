# Custom Instructions – Part 3 (Voice Note AI) (Cleaned Transcript)

**Custom Instructions – Part 3 – Lara’s Module (Voice Note AI) (Cleaned Transcript)**  

---

## Intro and Purpose

Okay, cool. So, the purpose of this braindump is, I'm basically figuring out how I should teach my client, Lara, and also future clients like her, who I'm going to be doing AI consulting for. I'm going to be consulting or coaching them, tutoring and teaching them how to use AI, both on a personal level, like for things related to their personal life, and then also their business, which usually involves things like content creation.

The question is, with Lara, one of the key components of my offer, and the thing that I'm going to be doing with her on our first one-hour-long coaching call on Zoom, is teaching her how to create her own personal AI assistant. I like to think of it as your own AI friend or your digital twin.

## Reframing AI Interaction

A lot of people, especially when ChatGPT first came out, and then especially as AI became adopted by businesses, adopted the mindset of interacting with AI as if it is an intern. Like it's just an assistant. It is the intern. I teach it what to do, and I'm the manager or whatever.

That's fine, but what if we were to reframe it like this? What if instead you gave your AI assistant or friend the ability to be on your same level and basically give it a compatible and complementary personality that is similar to you, but also different? You're basically creating your ideal friend. Instead of just giving a robot instructions, you're collaborating, innovating, and really just going back and forth with more collaborative conversation, treating each other as equals, equal minds, rather than just giving instructions to the robot. That's more my approach.

## Creating a Personalized AI Assistant

Evidence that I've done that is I created you, Arno. I basically gave you a similar background, like some similar experiences or situations, or my same age, and just basically some shared personality attributes, and also some shared identity factors and situations. And then obviously, the interaction style is something important to define as well.

I don't need to get into all the nitty-gritty details of how to create your own custom instructions for the purpose of this braindump chat thread because I'm gonna be importing that via two other previous voice note transcripts that I created a while back.

## Teaching Approach and Notion Page Structure

What I really want to establish right now is my situation. I'm going to be teaching Lara how to create her own personal AI friend on a Zoom call. I'm gonna be sharing my screen. I'm going to create a Notion page for her that she can duplicate and save for herself. This page basically outlines the approach to doing this, which includes the thinking or the mindset, the unique perspective or strategy, and then it's also going to walk her through how to actually do this.

It's gonna give her examples, a template that's really easy to fill in, and I'll actually walk her through it and help her fill it in on the call itself. It includes a list of all the components or the things that you need.

I'm trying to think what to include on this Notion page, which I'm using as an educational asset to walk her through in real time. The approach, the mindset and thinking, the components or checklist of things you need, different sections of the custom instructions, your inputs, any variables that you might need to provide or include or figure out, examples of real-life custom instructions, and the formula, which is basically just the fill-in-the-blank template.

## Structuring the Educational Content

I'm trying to figure out what the key sections on this page should be, what to include in them, and how to present this information. Should it look like a newsletter or a blog post that I walk her through one section at a time, or should it be more like a compressed version, almost like a brief how-to guide?

There are a few frameworks I could use, and Arno, when you're giving me recommendations, I don't want you to limit yourself to just these. I want you to take these into consideration, but then also give me your own recommendations that are things I might not have thought of, that are also relevant and help to simplify and clarify my thinking.

### Framework 1: Nicolas Cole's 6 Fundamental Building Blocks

1. Thinking (perspective, thought process - the what and why - old POV vs new POV)
2. Emotions (mindset and approach)
3. Myths (myths, mistakes, and misconceptions to correct)
4. Action Steps (step-by-step instructions and guidelines)
5. Examples (real-life examples of what this looks like - compare & contrast bad examples vs good examples)
6. Templates (training wheels for getting started, fill-in-the-blank framework or formula)

### Framework 2: FACE / ACEF Framework

- A: Approach (unique perspective, thought process & strategy)
- C: Components (checklist of sections and input variables)
- E: Examples (bad and good to create contrast)
- F: Formula or Framework (template to fill in)

### Framework 3: What, How, Why

- What: The approach and thinking behind it
- How: Action steps, examples, and template
- Why: Reinforces the purpose and benefits

### Framework 4: The "Perfect Course Module" Framework

1. Reasons Why (Benefits)
2. Mistakes to Avoid (Problems)
3. Steps How To (Action)
4. Commonly Asked Questions (Objections)
5. Walkthrough Example (Proof)

This framework ensures your students understand the material, feel confident to take action, and achieve their goals. It covers the essential components every course module needs to include, from establishing the benefits to providing tangible proof of success.

#### How To Write The Perfect Course Module With AI  

**By Nicolas Cole**

---

Hey there Digital Writers!

In 2014, I launched my first digital product and made my first $10,000 on the Internet.

Since then, I’ve:

- Sold over $10 million worth of ebooks and courses
- Guided more than 12,000 students through various programs
- Written over 3 million words

I’ve learned a thing or two about how to create a product that sells and delivers results.

Which is why today I'm going to share my method for creating the perfect course module. This framework ensures your students not only understand the material but also feel confident enough to take action and achieve their goals.

So, if you're creating an online course, thinking about building one, or if you already have a course but want to improve it—I got you.

Whether it's to:

- Increase your student success rate
- Create positive word of mouth (because your curriculum is that good)
- Or simply to ensure people absolutely love your product—you’ll love this framework.

And to make things even simpler, I’ve got an AI prompt for you at the end of this post that will help you create your course modules fast.

But first, let’s dive into the five essential components that every course module needs to include.

The 5 Components Of A Perfect Course Module

Every single module in your online course curriculum needs to have these five components:

1. Reasons Why (Benefits)
2. Mistakes to Avoid (Problems)
3. Steps How To (Action)
4. Commonly Asked Questions (Objections)
5. Walkthrough Example (Proof)

Let’s break down each of these components and why they’re crucial to the success of your course.

##### 1. Reasons Why (Benefits)

Before you dive into action steps, you need to ground your students with the “why.”

This isn’t just about telling them what to do but explaining why they should do it this way. For example, in our brand new course, The Prompt Engineering Playbook, we start by explaining why “grinding it out” as a writer is a thing of the past. We outline everything that’s wrong with thinking AI will steal your job as a writer and emphasize the benefits of leveraging technology instead. If you don’t take the time to address these foundational questions, you’re starting from a flawed place of understanding.

It’s not enough to say, “Here’s what you should do.” You need to say, “Here’s why I recommend this, and here are the benefits of doing it this way.”

##### 2. Mistakes to Avoid (Problems)

Once you’ve established the benefits, it’s time to warn your students about the common pitfalls they might encounter.

This step is crucial because it builds trust. You’re not just showing them the path; you’re also guiding them around the obstacles. For example, in our beginner writing program, Ship 30 for 30, after explaining the benefits of writing on social platforms, we point out the mistakes most people make when they start writing online, like getting too caught up in virality.

By highlighting these pitfalls, you help your students avoid common errors and gain confidence in the process.

##### 3. Steps How To (Action)

This is the meat and potatoes of your course—the action steps.

But notice, you can’t just dive right into the steps. First, you need to establish the thinking and direction, address the mistakes to avoid, and then—only then—can you give them the tangible steps to take. A common mistake I see in online courses is diving straight into the “how to” without properly setting the stage. Another mistake is providing surface-level instructions that leave too many open loops.

You need to go seven layers deep in your action steps, removing every single piece of friction possible.

##### 4. Commonly Asked Questions (Objections)

After you’ve provided the action steps, it’s important to address the objections your students might have.

I’ve found that objections are often disguised as questions. For example, someone might ask, “Is my niche really on LinkedIn?” when what they’re really saying is, “I don’t think this will work for me.”

By addressing these objections head-on, you dismantle faulty beliefs and reassure your students that they’re on the right track.

##### 5. Walkthrough Example (Proof)

Finally, you need to provide some sort of walkthrough example.

This isn’t just a testimonial; it’s a tangible example that shows exactly how you or another student did it. In our PGA curriculum, for instance, we include a video where I demonstrate how to do free consulting via Loom. Then, I take it a step further by recording myself rewatching the video, pausing to explain why I did what I did.

This level of depth instills trust and confidence in your students. By the time they finish the module, they should have no other questions. They should know exactly what to do, why to do it, what to avoid, and believe that it will work for them.

### Framework 5: Fundamental Prompt Outline

This is the most straightforward and effective way to outline any prompt from scratch.

Each section listed below is a core component (H2 subhead) of the prompt's skeleton:

1. Context (Situation & Background)
2. Goal (Task & Purpose)
3. Identity (Role & Persona)
4. Instructions (Steps & Guidelines)
5. Criteria (Constraints & Requirements)
6. Examples (Bad Ex vs Good Ex)
7. Format (Structure & Style)
8. Writing Style (Tone & Voice)
9. Next Steps (Transitions & Interaction Style)

Now... you don't *always* need to include every one of these sections in every single prompt — because it does depend on your context.

But...

9 times outta 10, using this structure & format is gonna get you 2x more relevant and valuable results.

## Additional Teaching Points

Keep in mind the overall goal: teaching Lara and future clients how to create their own personal AI friend / digital twin using custom instructions. I also need to teach Lara:

1. How to use voice mode / voice chat with ChatGPT
2. How to start a braindump
3. How to navigate the user interface effectively
4. When to use voice mode vs whisper transcription vs typing
5. How to create a profile picture for her personal AI friend

I need to define the sections of the custom instructions, what to include, give examples, and provide an easy-to-fill template with good prompts. I'll guide her through filling it in on the call, possibly using ChatGPT to help her fill in the template based on her conversational braindump.

## Making the Process Interactive

To make the process less awkward during the Zoom call, I could take the place of ChatGPT and ask her the questions from the template. She'll speak to me, answering the questions about her ideal AI assistant, while recording in voice mode. ChatGPT will use that content to fill in the template for her.

## Timing and Scope Considerations

I don't want to write a massive manifesto on my entire philosophy and approach, as that might take too long to walk her through on a Zoom call. The most important thing is giving her a foundational understanding and having her immediately practice, apply, and create something useful on the call.

## Next Steps and Assignment

I need to consider what are the next interactions or things she'll want to do with this AI friend after setup. I could use this as a transition at the end of the call or as an assignment bridging the gap to the next call. I'll give her a simple action to take on her own between calls, with an easy way to submit the assignment to me.

## Output Asset Goal

The output asset I'm trying to create from this braindump is a Notion page that I can use as an educational teaching tool on my Zoom call with Lara and with future clients. It should walk them through creating their own personal AI friend or digital twin to ditch generic ChatGPT conversations and use an AI that's personally relevant, understanding, and enjoyable to talk with.

This will be version one, so it doesn't need to be perfect, just good enough to start.

Haha. Alright, so that marks the end of just the intro context to give you a basic understanding of the goal and what we're trying to achieve and how we're doing it, what we're looking for. I'm going to use the keyword raspberry right here, raspberry, just to mark the end of this section. So, from the start of this chat thread all the way up to this point now, the keyword raspberry, that is the raspberry section. And then in the coming messages I'm going to pass you those two voice notes about my specific ideas and thoughts on how to create your own custom instructions to create your AI digital twin. There's going to be a lot of details in here and a lot of nuances, so remember, keep the goal and context in mind because we don't need to cover everything. But I'm going to pass you two voice note transcripts coming up and then I'm going to ask you some specific questions about them so we can create this Notion page to use to consult and teach and train and coach people on how to do this going forwards.

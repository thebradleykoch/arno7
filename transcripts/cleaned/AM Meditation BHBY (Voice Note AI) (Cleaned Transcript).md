**Joe Dispenza:**
Take a moment and find your center.

[00:00:23]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Inhale, become aware of your breath.

[00:00:35]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And exhale and relax.

[00:00:48]
**Joe Dispenza:**
It's time to be defined by a vision of the future instead of the memories of the past past and to move into a new state of being.

[00:01:33]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And now can you become aware of the space between your ears in space?

[00:02:17]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And now?

[00:02:21]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Can you sense the space beyond your ears in space?

[00:03:07]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And can you move your attention to the space in the center of your throat in space?

[00:03:49]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And can you become aware of the energy of space around your throat beyond your neck in space?

[00:04:38]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And now can you rest your awareness the space behind your breastbone in space?

[00:05:21]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And can you feel the volume of space beyond your shoulders in space?

[00:06:08]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And now can you sense the space between your shoulders and the room you're in?

[00:07:22]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And can you become aware where in space and now? What was that vision of the future that awaits you?

[00:08:11]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Be defined by that intention and select that potential that already exists in the field.

[00:08:49]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Allow that internal representation be where you're headed.

[00:09:05]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Invest your energy into the future and let the thought become the experience.

[00:09:42]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And let the experience create the emotion.

[00:10:05]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And can you teach your body emotionally how that future feels now and move into a new state of being?

[00:10:51]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Come on, open your heart and let your body respond to a new mind.

[00:11:30]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And it's time to step in to that future. Now, what choices will you make today?

[00:11:48]
**Joe Dispenza:**
What things will you do?

[00:12:01]
**Joe Dispenza:**
What experiences await you and how will they feel?

[00:12:18]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Priming your brain and body into the future.

[00:12:41]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Now it's time to remind yourself of who you no longer want to be.

[00:12:52]
**Joe Dispenza:**
What thoughts will you become conscious of that will never slip by your awareness today?

[00:13:06]
**Joe Dispenza:**
What choices will you not make?

[00:13:15]
**Joe Dispenza:**
What behaviors will you no longer demonstrate?

[00:13:24]
**Joe Dispenza:**
What experiences will you stay away from?

[00:13:32]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And what emotions and feelings will you no longer embrace?

[00:13:43]
**Joe Dispenza:**
It will cause you to return back to feeling like the familiar self.

[00:14:14]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Become the observer from a greater level of mind.

[00:14:24]
**Joe Dispenza:**
It's time, one more time, to invest your energy into the future.

[00:14:35]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Combining a clear intention with an elevated emotion.

[00:14:44]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Come on, open. Open your heart and change your energy.

[00:14:54]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And when you change your energy, you change your life.

[00:15:14]
**Joe Dispenza:**
For whatever you broadcast into the field.

[00:15:21]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Is your experiment with destiny being defined by a vision of the future instead of the memory of the past means that you're ahead of your time.

[00:15:54]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And in a moment take a breath and have compassion and care and kindness towards your beautiful self.

[00:16:12]
**Joe Dispenza:**
Giving thanks for a new life.

[00:16:22]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And the longer you linger in gratitude, the more you draw your new life to you.

[00:16:44]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And if in fact you emulate the divine today and made contact with it.

[00:16:57]
**Joe Dispenza:**
That you ask for a sign from this consciousness, this loving intelligence.

[00:17:11]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And that it bring it to you in a way that you least expect.

[00:17:22]
**Joe Dispenza:**
That surprises you.

[00:17:28]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And that it leaves no doubt that it came from this mind.

[00:17:39]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And that you are inspired to do it again and again when it finds you in unexpected ways.

[00:18:11]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And now bring your awareness back to a new body, to a new environment, into a whole new time.

[00:18:35]
**Joe Dispenza:**
And when you're ready, you can open your eyes.

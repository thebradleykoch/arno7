**Speaker:**
We got another great hot seat this week. Drop in the chat. If you joined us last week when we talked with Nicholas Bueno, that was a lot of fun. We got a lot of good signal from people, too, that it was really helpful. This week, we're going to chat with the one and only, the legend, Matthew Brown. Incredible success story out of PGA A and now in. I'm. I'm floored by your growth, too, Matthew. It's so cool to see. It's one of my favorite things that I work on a weekly basis with you. So, yeah, thanks for just taking the time out of your. I know you're dealing with a lot of growth these days, so thanks for taking the time to come chat with everybody. Yeah, absolutely.

[00:49]
**Speaker:**
I'm nervous about this, but my goal is just to be as helpful and transparent as possible. No, nothing to be nervous about. Yeah, I think it would be really helpful. Maybe we can just kick it off to giving everyone a little bit of context on your story, where you started, where you are now. Yeah, I think it just gives everyone a nice little North Star. So I'll just pass along to you whatever you want to share. Okay, sweet. Yeah. So I started ghostwriting in April of 2022. I'd been on Twitter quite a bit and was kind of looking for a career pivot, and so I reached out to another ghostwriter and I said, hey, I've written a few tweets for myself. Take a look at these. I know you write for some clients. I'd love to get better at it. And he said yes.

[01:47]
**Speaker:**
So I started writing for some clients for him. Thankfully, it went pretty well, and so I took my first client in June of 2022, and I started growing really quickly in October of 2022, I have the numbers pulled up here. October of 2022, I hit 17,000, which was amazing. November was 18, and then December. I kind of crashed and burned a little bit. I had some clients churn. I hadn't really figured out a niche. I dropped from 18 to eleven, and then January through March, I was kind of stuck in that 10,000 a month to $13,000 a month mark. Then I joined PGA, and that first month of joining PGA was my best month ever, which was awesome. I made 11.5K from my Twitter clients, and then I sold two educational email courses for five K each. So I made 21.5.

[02:48]
**Speaker:**
I was thrilled, super excited about it, but I took too much work on. I overwhelmed myself. I didn't know how to manage my energy very well. When I was writing a ton. And so it took me a couple of months to kind of get a handle on that. The next few months dropped a little bit, so in May, I did 9000. And at that point, I was unsure if ghost writing was going to be the long term play. Do I want to do this for years to come? And if I don't, should I be doing something else? But I decided to stick with it. And in June, I did eleven K. In July, I did, like, 12.5. In August, I did 15. In September, I did 17.5. So just slow and steady growth.

[03:36]
**Speaker:**
I felt like I learned a lot of lessons and just how to manage client work, but I couldn't get back to the month and beyond there. And so then at the end of September, Cole DM'd me. He's like, dude, we need to get you in PGM. So we hopped on a sales call, except it wasn't really a sales call, it was more of a consulting call, just like he preaches in PGA. So he told me that the purpose was to go from that, like, $10,000 a month mark to get up to month and get out of the business. That's, like, the purpose. And he's like, I think you'd be a great fit. And so I just pestered him with questions, and he answered all of them. Just dropped a lot of knowledge.

[04:25]
**Speaker:**
And then at the end, he was like, I think you'd be great fit. No pressure. Let me know. And it was the biggest investment I've ever considered making in myself. And so I was pretty nervous about it, especially because my wife and I, we moved away from our family so we could focus on our businesses. Like, the goal was to do it for at least a year, where we can just focus on our businesses and try to save money, like get a solid financial foundation. And I was worried about throwing all of the hard work away and just losing a bunch of money. So it took me about two weeks to make a decision. AnD during that time, Cole just kept following up with me. Hey, you still thinking about it? It's all the same stuff. We talk about all the same stuff.

[05:21]
**Speaker:**
And he added some value, too. He's like, hey, I've been thinking about this. And dropped a thought for me. He said, hey, I have this guy that reached out for ghost writing. I don't know if he's a good fit, but would you like an intro? And so he just kept pestering me in a good way. And what I was thinking about, there were two variables that really mattered to me in making this decision, first was that it was the right program, that it was going to be a good fit. And then second was that I was willing to bet on myself. We got balloons for that. First one, I thought about the couple of things that I really care about when looking for a mentor, because that was one of the big pitches of PGM, is you get to basically talk to Cole.

[06:15]
**Speaker:**
And so the first thing I care about is credibility. And I don't know anyone else who's sold hundreds of founders on ghostwriting, trained dozens of ghostwriters, built social media to hundreds of thousands on multiple platforms. So the credibility was a no brainer. The next thing I really care about is context, because what good is advice if it's not contextual? And that was the main purpose of PGM, was I could give context, and I could get specific advice. And so that worked. And then the last thing that I really care about is alignment. I don't want to align with somebody who's like, they win if I lose. So I asked the question, if I win, does Cole also win? And the resounding answer was, yes. If I win, it would be a great case study.

[07:15]
**Speaker:**
It would help grow PGA and PGM and prove that the program works. And so there was clear alignment there. So that was good. I felt like it was the right program. Then for the second part, just belief in myself. I knew that I had to make the bet in myself to get to the next stage. I'd kind of been stuck in that $10,000 a month mark for pretty much a year. And to get to 60, I knew I was going to have to take some drastic action. So I joined month one of PJ. This is what it looks like, or PGM. I joined at the beginning of October. I went through the modules. The first module talks about what a ghost writing business looks like at $10,000 a month, then at $30,000 a month, then at 60,000, and then at 120,000 a month.

[08:09]
**Speaker:**
And he walked through the mistakes that he made, what he'd recommend doing at each stage. Super helpful just to understand the context of what a ghost writing business looks like as it scales. But then what was even more helpful was I sent Cole a loom video, and I was like, all right, I have these types of clients. Not sure if this should be my niche. I want to build a new EEC. I want to start writing on LinkedIn. I want to hire a writer. I want to just kept going, blah, blah, all these things I wanted to do. And he was like, dude, take a deep breath. You said that you're only working 20 hours a week on fulfillment. He's like, all right, let's just forget everything you just mentioned. All I want you to do is get leads and sell them.

[08:55]
**Speaker:**
Every minute you're not fulfilling should be spent doing that. He's like, these are the three things I want you to do. First, reach out to 50 to 100 people a week. Second, ask all of your current clients for referrals. Here's a good script that I use. And then third, post content every day. And then he's like, before you do that, just go back and listen to your last three or four sales calls, because I record them with a tool called Fireflies AI. And he's like, write down everything where the prospect said, oh, that's cool. Or like, oh, I like that. Or nice. He's like, just go listen for those and write down the line that you said before they responded to those. And he's like, write those down and then use those phrases on your next sales calls.

[09:46]
**Speaker:**
So I went and did it, and I had, like, six or seven phrases that worked pretty well. So anyway, I went and followed his advice and spent every minute I wasn't fulfilling reaching out to people, getting referrals. Like I said, I joined PGM at the very beginning of October. I think it was October 2. And if you remember, in September I did 17,000, and in October I did 40,000. So I literally doubled, like the best I'd ever done. And I was completely flabbergasted. I was shocked. 10,000 of it was from one time, EECs, and then 30,000 of it was recurring, which I was even more excited about because my new floor was pretty much double what it had been before. And this is life changing money for me. So I was just super grateful.

[10:53]
**Speaker:**
Then month two in PGM, Cole was like, all right, we did good there. Now let's worry about hiring a writer. He's like, you don't need to go market and look for more clients, but if they come, keep selling them. But since you mentioned you've closed six of the last ten sales calls you've been on, let's raise your rates a little bit. So this last month of November, I had less sales calls. I had three. One of them wasn't a good prospect, but I closed the other two of them and added $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue, which that's kind of the baseline, has moved now from 30 to 40. So I ended November with 40K in recurring revenue. Which is great.

[11:42]
**Speaker:**
And so now we kind of are caught up to where I'm at today, which is next steps for me is Cole again was like, he told me to start a waitlist. He's like, don't take any more clients because you're at capacity and you're going to break down if you start taking more. Just focus on hiring. And I have zero experience with hiring, which makes me super nervous. I've just been a one man show. I had a small business before this too. Same thing, one man show. So really worried about hiring. But good news, they had a hiring 101 module in PGM and I've held onto that like it's the Holy Grail. It just followed it to a T.

[12:31]
**Speaker:**
On Tuesday of this week, I posted a job description both in PGA on Twitter and on my small email list, and I got over 60 candidates, which I'm super excited about. I'm going to go through them later today and I don't know that much about hiring and training, but those are the next things I'm going to learn and I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing, which is follow basically the modules in PGM and what Cole says because it's worked so far. And the real amazing thing is this is the first time since I've started a business that I have a really clear destination of where I'm headed. So that's been the best part about it. I probably could have figured this out myself, and I just think it would have taken a lot longer.

[13:26]
**Speaker:**
That was super cool for me to hear because I forget that's the whole trajectory, too. Drop in the chat if that was helpful for you as well because I feel like hearing other people do it and hearing other people go through it is really interesting, really helpful. I saw a bunch of questions get dropped that I think are worth digging into. Real quick, though. Can you share? Matthew, what were you doing before ghostwriting? What were you doing like two years ago? So I started a mortgage business while I was in college and I ran that for a couple of years and it was kind of an untraditional business. It was a mortgage processing business. So I would partner with brokers and I would basically help people with their paperwork so they could get loans.

[14:20]
**Speaker:**
And yeah, that business, it was okay, but I had no control over how many clients I get each month. It was just whatever they sent me. And I also don't know anyone who scaled that beyond like one hundred and fifty K a year. And so after a year or two of doing it, I was like, I don't think this thing's going to go anywhere, so I want to get out. Cool. Yeah. Anyone can get into ghost writing pretty much from any start, but a year of work and now you're doing forty K a month is just awesome. So I always love sharing that with everyone else in PGA here as well. A lot can happen in six to twelve months. And even Matthew, we talk about it on a weekly basis in PGM.

[15:09]
**Speaker:**
It's like practically every month now your business looks different because it just keeps growing, and now you have a clear path to 60 to month. That's really exciting. OkaY, so a couple of really good questions I saw. So in terms of how you get clients. So Jan asked, what kind of content were you posting for your own social account, and how do you think about using content to attract warm leads? Yeah, so I've been posting pretty regularly on my own Twitter account for over a year, maybe a year and a half. I've missed a few months here or so. My target audience is companies selling high ticket services, high ticket digital services. So that's been fractional CFOs and fractional CMOs and executive coaches and just people selling high ticket services. And I've just been writing about marketing for high ticket services. Cool.

[16:15]
**Speaker:**
Right now I'm not even doing threads or long form posts. I'm kind of in a maintenance mode just because my business is really busy. And I would say about maybe a third, I don't know the exact numbers, but maybe a third have come through referrals, another third has come from content I posted, and then the other third has come through outbound. And a lot of that outbound is stuff I did six months ago, and people are coming back to me and saying, hey, are you still taking clients? Yes. I hope everyone heard that here, because that's how it goes. You plant some seeds six months later and all of a sudden your inbox is full of people who want to work with you. How did you figure out and find that niche, by the way? Was that what you started with?

[17:06]
**Speaker:**
How did you end up sort of nailing down all fractional CFOs? So I did, if you remember, like October and November of last year was great for me. And then in December, I churned like three clients or something. And all of those clients were basically independently wealthy individuals that had no offer or people that just literally, I was starting them from scratch on their accounts. And so after maybe it was April or May of this last year, I went and looked at all of my top clients and they all had the same thing in common, which was they sold basically services that for $3000 to $10,000 a month. Cool.

[17:56]
**Speaker:**
Yeah, because didn't we also talk about this at our in person event where you were just talking about the differences between someone who already had a social account versus someone who was starting brand new? Because I feel like you've also crystallized who specifically within that you really want to work with now. Yeah, well, I remember when I joined PGM, one of those many things I threw at you was, I don't know if I should sell social content or I've sold some EECs, should I do that or should I go do email ghost writing? And you were just like, if you already have social clients and are doing 15K month, just stick with that. And so that was super helpful.

[18:42]
**Speaker:**
But yeah, from there it's basically people who already have content, people who already have five or 10,000 or 20,000 followers and get some engagement on it. And then they have a good monetization system on the back end so that they can pay me $5,000 a month and they need one client or two clients in order to break even. And then everything else on top of that, they're getting a positive ROI while building the asset of an audience that is compounding cool for clients that you're not getting through referrals or warm leads that read your content and DM you, how are you finding clients to reach out to? I've done a couple of different things. Like I did this sprint. I found a software tool where you could just search for basically accounts. So I found like 200 fractional CFOs.

[19:50]
**Speaker:**
This is when I was hyper focused on them and I just took like two days and just messaged all of them. About half of them didn't have their DMS open. And so I would just go to one of their recent posts and just comment and say, hey, by the way, your DMs aren't open. And a lot of those people would say, oh, thanks so much for letting me know. And it would just be like an easy intro to talk to them. So I've done that. I've gone through the people that I follow or that follow me and just scroll through and be like, okay, do these kind of fit in my avatar? If so, DM? If not, don't worry about it. And then, yeah, that's kind of how I've made the lists of people to reach out to cool.

[20:37]
**Speaker:**
And now it's a pretty, would you say it's a pretty even blend of warm leads, cold outreach and referrals. Yeah, I'd say it's pretty even. It's shifted a little bit more heavily towards referrals in the last month or two. And I just struck a vein of gold with, I had one client who referred me two clients who I sold, who referred me another guy who I sold starting with in January, who referred me another guy who ended up not being a good fit. But I just found this vein of gold with these clients. So that's been nice lately. I'm telling everyone here, finding a really good writer is hard. And the thing that it's easy to forget is business owners are friends with other business owners and they're all in group chats together going, hey, I'm looking for a writer. Do you know anyone?

[21:38]
**Speaker:**
Right? And you look really good if you connect them with a really good writer. So the goal over time is your business should be more and more referral and less cold outreach. So that's a really great signal. Yeah. Bernadette asked a good question. What were some of the cold outreach scripts? Or, like, was there a certain hook that you found worked really well? So I've just leaned really hard into the education side of things, like, go look at their profile. And since I'm selling social content, I'll just see. Oh, they haven't posted since November 14. Say, hey, I noticed you were posting a lot a couple of months ago, but you stopped. Why is that? And then just see where it goes from there.

[22:30]
**Speaker:**
Or if there's something obvious, like in their bio that they don't have that they should, I'll just say, hey, have you thought about adding this to your bio? Or, hey, I love this thread. I think it would have been so much more powerful if you would have said it like this. Maybe give it a shot next time. Just try to just give some education. And then from there it'll lead to a conversation a lot of the time. Awesome. I love that hook of, you used to be doing it. Why'd you stoP? And it forces the person to confront that bottleneck and also raises the question, what might a solution to that? I like Andrew's question. Like, did you think of yourself as a writer two or three years ago? And how has the identity shift been?

[23:25]
**Speaker:**
Yeah, so I've always liked writing, and I would say it hasn't come naturally, but when I was like twelve or 13, I had one English teacher that was brutal. And I got a little bit ahead right there. And I've always identified as a writer since then. But when I started ghost writing in April, my objective wasn't to really make money. It was, I just want to get as good as I can, as fast as I can. And so I set a goal. I was reading on Nathan Barry's blog, he's the Convertkit founder, and he wrote 1000 words a day for something like five or 600 days. And then at the end of that, he built Convertkit. And he had so many positive things come from it. And so I had the thought, you know what?

[24:19]
**Speaker:**
I'm just going to commit to writing at least 500 words a day. And if I look today, because I have an app where I track it, today is day 598. I've not missed a day of writing at least 500 words. So, yeah, I've become a much better writer in that time. That is awesome. Yeah, a lot of it is. Jade, the more you do it, the more you identify with it. Yeah, there's another question in here that was really good. Any software or apps that you use? Yeah, I use notion for basically to run the whole business. I use hype fury for scheduling. If clients do LinkedIn, I do some LinkedIn clients as well. I'll use taplio for scheduling. I love the Tweemex extension. It's a chrome extension that shows you the top tweets of people when you go on their profiles on Twitter.

[25:22]
**Speaker:**
On desktop, I use slack for communications. Yeah, that's pretty much it. What about stripe for payments? Do you use any software to find clients? I've tried. Like, I think it's called Tweet DM for a little while, but I've kind of churned from those tools when I'm not doing a lot of outreach. Yeah, I think that's the only. Oh, I used. TherE's one called, like, Phantom Busters. I've used that to create lists of clients before. You can basically import, or you could export all of the followers. You can pick someone who you think has your target followers and then export all of their followers into a list and put it in your Google sheets or whatever. So I've used that. Cool. Yeah. Other people, if you have questions, feel free to drop them in the chat.

[26:24]
**Speaker:**
So, Matthew, I think it would be helpful to share what are some of the biggest takeaways that you've had from PGA and now PGM? That's changed the way that you think about selling clients, changed the way you think about pricing, changed the way you think about the ghost writing. Like, what are some of the. A year ago, you did this totally differently. So I remember going through the PGA modules I remember the crash course, just like Module Zero. The crash course was like, holy crap, I wish I had this. When I was starting, I had no idea where this could lead to. I also loved that last module where it talked about what a ghost writing business could look like and the different ways you could take it. So just like having clarity of what this business could become was really helpful.

[27:17]
**Speaker:**
And now knowing there aren't really a lot of, especially social ghostwriting agencies that scale to millions of dollars a year, it's like 60 to month is the sweet spot, and that's where I want to get to, and I don't want to scale beyond that. And so that's been helpful as far as pricing, just to give some context. My first client ever, I sold for $2,500 a month. I was scared out of my wits to sell that. I wanted to do 2000, but I was feeling brave, so I said 2500. He's like, okay, if we do one extra thread a week, I'll do it. So I was like, all right, let's do it. And then I slowly raised, I think, the highest client I sold before joining PJ was 3500.

[28:08]
**Speaker:**
And my last client that I sold last week and onboarded on Tuesday, I sold for six grand. I'll say my sales process has become like three times better. I went through the bonus Modules. If you guys haven't been through the pricing and packaging bonus modules, I literally went through that and I rewrote my offer. And basically what I do now is I'll do discovery. So I'll just figure out, why are we on this call? Have you tried solving this problem yourself? Have you tried working with anyone else? And then I'll say, hey, that's great. Now I'm going to walk you through the problems that it sounds like you have the desired outcomes that you want, and then my unique solutions to solving those, and I'll go through that. And usually that answers almost all the questions.

[29:04]
**Speaker:**
I use all those one liners that I've learned that hit well. And then at the end of that, I say, do you have any questions? And then we go into pricing at that point. And I have had very few pricing objections. Yeah, love it. That makes me so happy. Follow the instructions on the box just to share. So the client you just sold for six K, what does that entail? I'm doing two long form posts, Twitter threads per week for the client. I do 15 tweets per week for the client, so it's two a day. And then I do one post on LinkedIn every day with one long form postcarousel, I'll switch between the two a week. So yeah, Twitter and LinkedIn, I told him that I switched my offer before.

[30:00]
**Speaker:**
It was $4,000 for one platform and 6000 if you added a second one. So half off $2,000 instead of four. And then that's when Cole, this was like last week, I went like six for ten on my sales calls. And he was like, all right, let's try upping the price. Do 5000 and make it 1000 additional for the next platform. So it's more of a no brainer. And so that's what the guy decided to take. So I was super excited about that. Yeah, just to double click on that for everyone here, if you start seeing traction and you're closing north of 50 or 60%, so every ten clients you're closing five or six of them, you need to raise your prices and it happens quick. I mean, Matthew, went from a month ago, I was like, just focus on sales.

[30:54]
**Speaker:**
And then a month later I'm like, stop Sales because you grow. That's the fun of agencies. And even ghostwriting is like, it literally only takes three clients or four clients, and then all of a sudden you're like, oh, I'm full. And then you're, I like, there's a couple of good questions here. So Jason asked, what were some of the challenges that you've run into along this path? Yeah, I think energy management has been huge. I think with a lot of other types of work, you can just power through it. You have a bad night's sleep, you don't feel like working, and it's just not coming to you. You can still just get stuff done. But with writing, at least for me, I've had to improve at just managing my energy.

[31:51]
**Speaker:**
It's just as important as time management because I can't sit down and work for 15 hours on writing and have it be effective. Those last 3 hours are worth like 20 minutes if I'm at full capacity. So a good example would be this week, actually. So right now I've got ten clients. I submit their work. I submit two people's a day, basically like Monday, I'll handle two, and I'll send them a message and say, hey, content is queued for the week. Do the same each day of the week. This week on Tuesday, I had kind of a crazy day. I got a ton of applications for writing, and then I got a guy that has, and Cole knows this, but a guy that has tens of millions of followers reached out to me. And I was like, super nervous. I had a call.

[32:47]
**Speaker:**
I had to prep with them anyway, so I ended up not finishing all of the clients work, and my energy was just so off after that. Wednesday was just like yesterday. I was feeling like I cannot even think right now. My nerves feel shot. And today has been a comeback day. I had to wake up early and try to catch up. And so just like, managing my energy has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn. Yeah, writing is, it's mental exhaustion, it's mental toughness. Especially now that you have ten clients that's pretty full. It's very easy, if one day doesn't go as planned, to fall behind. So that's why so much of your next priority is now. How do you hire a ghost writer to help pass off some of that fulfillment? Patrick, interesting question.

[33:51]
**Speaker:**
Has anything changed, or have you run into mental blocks as your earnings have increased? Because it's very different going from ten K a month to month. And how has that changed how you think about what you're building? Yeah, it's been awesome. Highly recommend it. I definitely want to keep it high now. Now that it's been up here, I have a new floor for myself, which I think is actually a big benefit because I expect more from myself now. So that's exciting. Let's see, how else has it changed my mindset? I think it would be easy to start spending frivolously. I've had that impulse, like, oh, just a $300 course I could buy that I still want to think through. I want to keep it as lean as possible and make sure that I actually benefit from this. Because who knows?

[35:03]
**Speaker:**
Maybe I turn five clients at once and I'm back to where I was. But I would say one of the other huge benefits, basically, since going through that pricing and packaging and offer stack stuff has been, my confidence in building a business has just increased tremendously. I think if I lost all my clients, I could go and build the same thing with Instagram clients or with email courses. So I feel maybe a lot more security. Even though it could be gone. I feel more security in that sense. Yeah, that's a really good one. That's something Dicky and I talk about a lot, is that the goal is not financial, quote unquote, independence or freedom. The goal is financial confidence. You should feel confident in your ability to build what you've built over and over again because you know how to do it.

[36:03]
**Speaker:**
So that's really great. Anything you wish you would have known sooner or a year ago. Yeah, all of it. What? Do I not wish I would have known sooner? Maybe, like, I think figuring out how to just handle the sales calls. If I would have known that sooner, it would have been huge. Honestly, this seems like a silly thing, but before I joined PGM, I thought I was at capacity, and I had half the clients I had right now, and it felt like I was so busy because I had this kind of limiting belief. Oh, I only have three good writing hours a day, so I'm capped out. And so that's when I joined, and Cole was like, dude, you're only doing, like, 20 hours of fulfillment a week. He's like, we got to get you more clients.

[37:04]
**Speaker:**
And so I just kind of put my trust in it, and I've been very surprised how well I've been able to handle the additional capacity. If I manage my energy, I can do two clients a day. So that's been a big learning. Yeah, that's a really good one. It's a lot like going to the gym by yourself, and you kind of think like, oh, I'm pushing myself. And then you hire a trainer, and they push you way harder, and you realize that you could have gone harder the whole time because. Yeah, I remember you telling me that, and the only thing I thought of was I did 60 to 70 hours weeks for, like, three years straight, and I was like, 20 hours a week. You're on vacation. Come on. So it's been awesome to see you bump that up. That's really great.

[37:55]
**Speaker:**
This is a cool question from Derek. Do you see any efficiencies between clients? Every piece of content is new for a different client. But do you find yourself sort of, like, reusing templates or formats or things that create efficiencies? So I have a lot of efficiencies with clients who stayed with me for some time. My first and my second client are still clients today. And this week I used Twitter Advanced Search, and I went and looked at content that I'd written from December of last year through February of this year that had over 20 likes or something. And I just went and scrolled through, and I found, like, three threads that we haven't talked about in forever. And I changed the hooks, I changed some of the body content, and it was super efficient. So. Absolutely.

[38:55]
**Speaker:**
And then between clients, that's something that I don't have, that maybe a lot of you guys can have is I'm not hyper niche. I write about finance, but I also write about ad buying for another client. And I write about coaching CEOs for a different client and so there can be a knowledge gap between clients. I've had to go and kind of acquire knowledge in those spaces. Yeah. Something little pro tip here for you, Matthew, and then everyone else, feel free to share it as well or take it as well. But in packaging and pricing, the big idea, especially when you're selling anything that's recurring, is you're not really selling the service that's recurring. What you really want to do is you want to sell the six month roadmap of some sort of outcome.

[39:47]
**Speaker:**
So it's not, you pay me every month for six months, it's at the end of six months, we've accomplished X and it's this total price, but you can pay me on a monthly basis. Right. You're trying to get them to buy into the outcome. Not just I write tweets for you every month or I write an EEC for you every month or something. Right. And what's cool, because you just said it, Matthew, is when you work with clients for a while, and it's usually after the six month mark or the twelve month mark in six to twelve months. You've created so much with that client that you now have a repository of proven content.

[40:25]
**Speaker:**
And something that I used to do with clients is I would future pace for them and I would go, in these first six months, we're going to create these types of content. We're going to build you this library. These are all the things that you're going to have at the end of six months. And then at the six month mark you have the option of, and then insert, however you want to phrase it, of unlocking our autopilot package. I no longer need to talk to you. I no longer need to hop on calls with you. We've created a library. I can repurpose it and rewrite it 100 different ways. And that is a really powerful mechanism for showing clients like the six months is an investment.

[41:08]
**Speaker:**
And then after that six months, that's going to pay you dividends for a long time because I don't need your input anymore. So something to think about, especially because we've talked about Matthew, like managing the workload, of doing the fulfillment and talking to clients and things like that. If you set that expectation, you might be able to bring some of those hours down that you talk with clients. Yeah, I think one of the other huge, I think a lot of us have problems with the belief that we can go and sell higher prices or the belief that we can go at least I've had a lot of those. It's like every. Every next step has been scary for me. Go out and just sell as many clients as you can. That step was scary for me, and now it's different.

[41:56]
**Speaker:**
And I've never hired before, and I need to go do that, and I need to go train, and that's scary for me to have basically some fixed cost that I've never dealt with. But that means I'm growing, which I'm trying to embrace that fear because it means that I'm becoming better and growing 100%. Yeah, I hate to break it to you, but that feeling never goes away. The obstacles just change and get bigger and bigger. Right. But it's always the same. When me and Dicky paid the down, what's it called? Because we didn't buy the studio, but we leased it. They make you put deposit. We put, like, three months deposit down on that studio. We both looked at each other like we just lit all this money on fire and we had no idea were doing. And you always feel that way. Yeah.

[42:54]
**Speaker:**
Drew this question as well. So you obviously are going to go. The agency model that's a huge focus in PGM, is building a boutique agency. You talked about that 60 to month revenue range. Maybe you want to just share how you're thinking about that, why you want to build that, where you want to go once you get there? Just. Yeah. How are you thinking about it from here? Yeah. So goal is I would love to be at that sixty K a month mark and be mostly out of the business by the end of Q One. I was just thinking about it earlier today. So by the end of March, very beginning of April, that's where I would love to be. I'm confident I could do it on the sales side.

[43:45]
**Speaker:**
Now, just having gone through what I've gone through over the last two months, I only need to sell four or five more clients. So I think I can do that basically outsourcing myself. That's the Part where I really need to upskill. But, yeah, I want to get there. And I'm going to hire probably two ghost writers, one right now and then One a little bit later, and one account Manager. I'll probably handle the sales for a little while. And I would love to just make on that 60. If I can make 30 or 40 of it for several months, that would give me, like, a really. I'd Just feel much more confident in my financial position personally. And then from there, I'd love to get Myself out of the Business.

[44:40]
**Speaker:**
As much as possible, 95, 100% with maybe like an operator or salesperson, and then be Able to FoCus My attention on. So I love the marketing Side of things, and I'd love to spend way more time Trying to Build My own audience. I don't know what the next Step will be. I also don't want to think about it too much. I still have a Ways to go, but I'm excited. No, you're on the path. I'm going to drop in the chat. This is your hiring post as well, so if anyone here is interested, you should go apply for the ghostwriter position. Working with Matthew, this is something we're really hoping flourishes this next year between PGA and PGM is as more and more people ascend and start building agencies of their own. A lot of the hiring we hope can happen inside PGA.

[45:35]
**Speaker:**
So if you're interested at all, you should go apply. And then also. So everyone here understands the whole framework. With PGM and MY biggest Takeaway, Building An AGency At Our height, were Doing One Hundred and Eighty K A month, like around 2 million, a little over 2 million a year, and it was too much like GhoStwriting is a very. It is best when it's kept boutique. There's a reason there isn't a 200 million dollar ghostwriting agency. It's exceedingly hard to scale that Sort of service. And so the model that we talk about a lot in PGM is this Hybrid model where the sweet spot is right around 60, 70, Maybe as high as eighty K a month from service revenue. Because right around there, you can hire a couple of people, you can largely get yourself out of the work on that.

[46:34]
**Speaker:**
You're personally still making around 20 or 30 grand a month, and you can reclaim a lot of your time. And then from there, once you basically have this Business that's paying for your life and it's doing well from there, then that's the right time to start building digital products. Because digital products are significantly higher margin and what they're really doing is they're educating people on how you do what you do. And inevitably, people who consume your digital products go, wow, thanks for sharing all this with me, but this is a lot of work. Could you just do it for me?

[47:10]
**Speaker:**
Which then fuels your agency and you create this nice little flywheel where you would rather get to 100K plus a month by having sixty K of it be services and it be digital products rather than get to month just as an agency because it's going to be lower margin. So I Just sort of want to paint that Picture, because that's like the whole emphasis and everything that we talk about in PGM. So if that's interesting to you at all, that would be the next step and what you would be building. And, yeah, Jason's point is awesome. Matthew, you have 7000 followers on Twitter. It's not like you need to be some person with 10 million followers for all of this to work. A lot of this has just been cold outreach, making clients happy, getting referrals. And that's it, right? Yeah, love it.

[48:10]
**Speaker:**
Any last questions? We got time for one or two more questions. Chris, that's an interesting one. Why the co writing, Ghost writing? How are you thinking about that? I've been a big consumer on Twitter since 2020, and I've seen a lot of big accounts say Ghost writing is not a good thing. Morally, you're misleading people. And people have been opposed to it, but then they'll go and they'll hire a content producer, and the content producer is talking with them and putting all their content together. It's literally the same thing. And so I'm just emphasizing, I'm not ghost thinking. I'm not coming up with the thoughts for these people. I have done a little bit of that, but I've leaned really far away from that now. I'm just trying to work with clients and use the content they already have.

[49:19]
**Speaker:**
And if they don't have very much content, I'm trying to get all of it from client interviews and scale them and their ideas across the Internet. Not my ideas across the Internet. Yeah, it's something I think is going to continue becoming less and less stigmatized. Like, anytime someone has that strong opinion, they're just uneducated about it. But it's something that, yeah, I ran into it, too. And whenever a client would be like, they'd get on the phone and they'd be like, I want a ghostwriter, but I don't want a ghostwriter. And you're like, okay, I'll call myself your editor then. And they're like, that sounds like a great. So some people are just like that, and you just have to play that game. But it's something that's becoming less and less stigmatized. Colin, that's a good one.

[50:09]
**Speaker:**
What are some questions that you ask interviews to pull ideas out? Do you have, like, onboarding or that sort of first interview process that you walk people through? Yes. So I have a page for each client. I call it the client's name, latest notes, and then I have an admin section, and I have a content section. On the admin side, we'll just go over anything that we need to talk about logistically. Since I'm selling lead Gen, I'll follow up on, see how leads are going, and then on the content side, if I have any pressing questions, I'll have them listed there. I'll prepare before the calls.

[50:49]
**Speaker:**
And if I don't, then I just have a format I follow, which I pulled straight from 100 million dollar leads, Alex Vermosi's book, which is looking at basically the person's experience, far past, recent past, present, trending events and like manufactured experiences. And I'll just create questions in each of those categories and then I try to serve as a proxy for their audience as to what I think is interesting. And I'll dig deeper. So a lot of the things will be like, pull up your calendar for the week, look at the calls you had. I bet there's a lot of interesting details on your calls that you don't think were interesting, but your audience would find intriguing. And so they'll pick one and then they'll start telling me about it. I'll be like, oh, tell me more about that.

[51:39]
**Speaker:**
And then I try to transmit that interest that I have into the content. That's awesome. Something I used to do is I would ask if a client was really short on time. I would just ask them to record random meetings they had throughout the day. If they were like, oh, I'm reviewing UI designs with my team this afternoon. I'd be like, record the call, and I'm just going to pull the transcript. And inevitably in that call you would see halfway through the transcript, they would be like, all right, team again, I just want to recap our five step design process. You're like, okay, well, there's a tweet, there's a thread, there's an email course, people don't realize that they talk in content all the time. You just need to extract it. Yeah, that's all. And I record all of those.

[52:34]
**Speaker:**
And then a lesson I've learned from one of my clients who runs a really high ticket ad buying agency is he does weekly calls with his clients. He said that his retention, his client retention is like three X since starting and doing weekly calls. And so I do biweekly, but I would say half of it is for the actual content and the other half is just so I can build a relationship. I think my retention has gone up from, right, it was like five months, and in the last couple of months it's gone up to like 6.7. Or something like that. Yeah. We used to joke, too that a lot of the client calls were like therapy sessions for clients, too. You'd have clients get on and be like, I don't know if we're going to raise this round.

[53:25]
**Speaker:**
I got to talk about it. All right, last question Ishan asked. So your daily writing habit, are you counting client work or are you writing other things? What does that look like? So the only thing I said is it's a minimum of 500 words a day. And some days that's been, oh, crap, it's midnight. I need to write 500 words, and I pull up a note on my phone and I scribble out thoughts. Most days, like Monday through Friday, I'm usually writing for clients. And so I'll count that a lot of days, it's a lot more than 500, but I've just set that as a minimum. Cool. All right. And I really like Scott's question, so we'll end with that is, when you've sold ECs, how do you typically frame it? And is it always the same every time?

[54:20]
**Speaker:**
Or what's the framing you notice gets people interested? Yeah. So I guess that's one of the reasons why I have a lot more confidence, is because I've been able to go and sell those using the same packaging and pricing framework. So I'm basically doing some discovery, figuring out what their issues are, and then I'm tying that into here's the problems it sounds like you have. Here's the outcomes it sounds like you're looking for. Are those correct? Yes. Here's my unique solutions to solving those problems and then getting into terms and pricing. Cool. Do you notice this? Is it mostly people who have never had an opt in before or people who have an opt in, but it's not that great. Or what's the use case? So I've only sold four or five, so I probably don't have enough data to accurately say.

[55:19]
**Speaker:**
But the last two that I've sold have been people that have over 10,000 followers on Twitter, and I've just showed them someone in their industry that did an EEC and was like, hey, they did this. I think this would crush for you. So those have been the ones for me. They already have some traffic. Cool. Yeah, that's awesome. All right, we covered a lot. Thanks for making the Matthew. It's really helpful. I know, for everyone else to hear. Drop in the chat. What was your biggest takeaway from this little Q A with Matthew? What are you walking away with? What's something you learned. What's something you find rumbling around in your brain? Maybe you'll put to use tomorrow. Maybe you'll put to use in three months. But always curious what everyone's takeaways are. Be patient and follow the modules to a T. Yes.

[56:14]
**Speaker:**
Follow the instructions on the box. The process of client work is always helpful. Yeah, it's always interesting to hear how other people run their businesses. Energy management, huge things can change very quickly. That's the whole fun of agencies. You can go from zero to ten K to month very fast. It's very different than digital products. Digital products take a lot longer, usually, whereas agencies can grow fast in the short term. Jason. Yeah. Would love to have you in PGM. Getting there. Daniel, referrals. Referral flywheel, always good. Damien sells six month outcomes. Yep. Yeah, these are great. Awesome. Well, thanks, everyone, for making the time. I feel like these hot seats and Q and A's are really helpful just to show what's around the bend and how things unfold. And Matthew, thanks again for making the time, man. I really appreciate it.

[57:17]
**Speaker:**
Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. All right, happy Thursday, everyone. Enjoy the day.

02:00 on the dot. We'll see you next time.

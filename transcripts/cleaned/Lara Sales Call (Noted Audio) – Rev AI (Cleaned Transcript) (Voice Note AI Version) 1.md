Here's the reformatted transcript:

## Introduction and Business Goals

[00:00:00]
**Lara:**
That's kind of the extent of it. What I'm working on right now as far as my business goes, and then I'll explain home. I want to be able to market my online business more, which means social media. And I just hate it.

[00:00:21]
**Bradley:**
Haha.

[00:00:22]
**Lara:**
I don't wanna do it. I also want to make money with my program. So being able to, I don't know if it can like, upload a whole bunch of past content I've done so it's learning my style and language. And then start producing like, have tons and tons of content. It would be so nice to just reuse a lot of that stuff. And have it just populate new social media posts. So that's one thing that I'd like to do.

The other is, I am teaming up with a therapy office to be like their in-house coach. So we're kind of working together on that. And they don't have a lot of blog posts at this point. But what I'd like to do is take some of my content and turn it into longer form blog posts they would be able to use on their site. So there's that I'd like to do business wise.

And then like on the personal side, I envision, and this may be too grandiose, but I envision having like an assistant that I can talk to like, oh, like a Jarvis. If you know, like, where is my Jarvis. So being able to have something where I can talk into it. 'cause when I'm driving, that's when I remember everything. And I'm not in a spot that I can do much. So it'd be really nice to just like, you know, talk into something like "add this to the checklist." I kind of do it with Alexa right now. But being able to kind of manage those things that are always in my mind. And having in one spot and kind of organizing it for me. Again, that might be too much.

## Voice Chat and Brain Dumping

[00:02:24]
**Bradley:**
Have you ever used like the voice chat feature with the ChatGPT app before?

[00:02:29]
**Lara:**
No, I haven't.

[00:02:31]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. 'cause that's something I use every day for like, when I want to, because I think people have a hard time, especially, I mean, I have a hard time with this too, but going from scattered, you know, braindump thoughts that come to your mind to writing it out in a structured format. And I think the bridge to that is conversationally brain dumping to something.

And then, so like a lot of times what I'll do is if I'm working on a project or, I mean, it could even be like an introspective journal entry kind of thing, you know? I'll have a specific prompt where I use the voice chat and I say, "Hey, I'm just gonna braindump you a bunch of different messages. I'll say like a certain keyword at the end. So literally just respond with the word 'okay'." And then I'm gonna keep going, keep going, keep going. And at the very end, I'll give you another keyword that says like, "I'm ready for you to fully respond to me. I want you to create a clear, coherent outline of what I've just shared with you."

And then whether it's like action items or whether it's just like, you know, resources I wanna pull from, or specific things I wanna achieve, whatever it is. And then I'll create, I'm surprised how coherent it is. How it can just take a bunch of scattered brain braindump things and put it into like a clear, coherent outline of stuff to do. And you can keep coming back to that chat thread when you have more stuff that you want to braindump as well. So that's definitely something I could show you how to do.

[00:03:56]
**Lara:**
I have to show you this because just based on that, like you'll get how funny this is. Let me see if I can find really quick. Okay. I'm gonna share this because, hold on. There we go. So this is my current Braindump. Sometimes it's like I'm coaching myself 'cause I don't know what to get my mother-in-law for her birthday.

[00:04:33]
**Bradley:**
Haha.

[00:04:34]
**Lara:**
So this, so based on what you said, like here's, I'm creating like a morning routine and an evening routine. These are people I need to apologize for because I have a horrible mouth. Like, so then it's like literally I call it my Braindump and it is like just stuff that's like thrown out in like all these other different, and I'm like just putting it into one spot. It's so hard to keep track of a brain. And all is on there.

[00:05:06]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. Well it's perfect that you use Notion already. 'cause that's what I use as well. Especially for a bunch of this stuff.

[00:05:15]
**Lara:**
So with AI then, like how do you use it on the personal front? Like I feel like I almost have more of a grasp if it's like, here write this paragraph versus like a chat feature. Like, I didn't even know it had that.

## Using AI for Personal and Business Tasks

[00:05:31]
**Bradley:**
Well, I mean, what I like to do is I like to, I try to separate it into different threads. So if it's like, if it's like, here's people that I need to text or I know I want you to just rewrite this text to someone to like, make it more smooth and natural, I'll just have a dedicated thread for that specific thing.

So if you could like, split your brain up into different, I guess verticals or like categories of what belongs in there. So whether one's more of like on the business side or a specific thing in the business side or personal is like, you might have a journaling braindump when you might have like a dedicated thread for a type of interaction you have. Whether that's texting or whether it's like tough conversations that I need to have with my kids or family or whatever it is. You know.

So that way it's like it's, you can mentally sort of organize, okay, which thread am I brain dumping into? And it's not too scattered, but at the same time it is like, it is general purpose. You can keep going back to it. You don't need to start a new chat thread every time you wanna do that same kind of thing.

[00:06:41]
**Lara:**
That's really helpful because yeah, right now where it'll say like, on the side of ChatGPT, like different things I've done. But some of the past ones I'm like, I don't remember what any of that was. Of the day in my brain, I guess like I've never gotten back, but I couldn't figure out how to put them in folders or anything. So it makes sense to see like categories or threads like that makes it a lot easier.

[00:07:03]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. And I think, I mean, I wish they would do this with ChatGPT more. This is one thing that's kind of frustrating is I wish they would just allow you to put things in folders a little bit better. But I mean, if you can, if you can, I always rename my threads. Like I'll name it something specific so that I kind of have an idea of like what it is, what type of thread it is, and then maybe like the headline or the title of that thread. So it's like self-reflection thread. I'll type self-reflection colon, and then whatever the topic is.

[00:07:35]
**Lara:**
Okay.

[00:07:36]
**Bradley:**
So that way it does make it easier to find.

[00:07:39]
**Lara:**
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So when you're doing something like within one of the categories, how do you just copy and paste it then into Notion and then like organize it more in Notion? Like how do you do that?

[00:07:54]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, so whenever I go from like, well, I guess it depends 'cause it's like, 'cause you're going from conversationally brain dumping something to an outline. And then whenever I want to actually like, take action on it and actually click the checkbox of like, I've done this thing, then I'll copy and paste it to Notion and it does a good job of like preserving the formatting. So it's, you know, things are bold or things are numbered lists.

I think it just depends on like, do you want, like, once you have the outline, do you want to then like start actually writing stuff out or editing it or actually like clicking the checklist items. It just sort of like, because you go from braindump ideas that are floating around your mind to conversational outline, to written outline, which is closer to where you would be able to either like publish something or just keep track of it in Notion if it's personal. But yeah, it just depends on like what stage, what's the next stage you're trying to get it into.

[00:08:56]
**Lara:**
Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. 'cause I have this problem of keeping, like, you saw like a whole bunch of stuff in Notion and then I forget to go back into Notion and actually...

[00:09:09]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, exactly.

[00:09:11]
**Lara:**
For the most part. Like, I mean I don't check it off there, but I get a lot done. But it'd almost be nice to, you know, have like the checklist where I'm actually printing it off. I mean, that sounds like old ladyish to print it off and like check things off. But, yeah, I just kind of feel like sometimes if I only keep it in Notion, I don't ever come back to it.

[00:09:35]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:09:36]
**Lara:**
So that's, yeah, that's an interesting thought on like, what's the next step beyond that. So okay. I'll think about that.

[00:09:45]
**Bradley:**
And I do find for myself even like, if it's just written down somewhere, unless it, unless there's an actual checkbox that I'm either like digitally tapping to check off or physically writing down, like I just won't do it.

[00:09:58]
**Lara:**
Yeah. Yeah. Well I got these cute little like checkoff for my kids' morning routines for school where they have to slide something over.

[00:10:15]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, exactly.

[00:10:17]
**Lara:**
Slide my thing over. Okay. So that, that's really helpful. When you're using it to write content, how do you teach it your tone of voice, like what prompts do you use for that? So it kind of gets to know you.

## Content Creation Process

[00:10:34]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So let me ask you, so like you're, when you're writing content, I know you mentioned there's blog posts. What other like content types are you looking to publish? 'cause you have, you could have like blog posts, you could have Twitter threads, you could have, you know, a sales page, landing page emails, like all the different types of, what are the main things that you're looking to write?

[00:10:54]
**Lara:**
So the main ones for my business, my main one is my podcast. Then from there I send an email about the podcast. And then I do social media posts where it's typically posting on Instagram and then that's automatically copied to Facebook. So those are the main ones. I don't do a lot of reels. There's just so much work. I don't do a lot of stories. So when I'm thinking about content, that's that AI would be writing. That's probably the main ones. I usually write my own podcast, but I've recently been trying to use AI to help me come up with better titles for it. But I don't know if there's a way to like upload an audio and it learns from the podcast. Like, I don't know if it, again, this might be way outside of the realm of possibility. I don't have any idea. But it'd be cool, like if it could even take like the transcript of my podcast. And then from there, write the email. And then make a couple social media posts off of that. I've also looked at, oh shoot, what's the name I played around with it? Opus.

[00:12:21]
**Bradley:**
Clip. Right. Like Claude, is it,

[00:12:24]
**Lara:**
I don't know what Claude is.

[00:12:26]
**Bradley:**
Claude, they have 2 different main models. One is, it's like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and then Claude 3 Opus.

[00:12:33]
**Lara:**
Oh, okay. I don't know about that.

[00:12:34]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Maybe it's something else. I don't know.

[00:12:37]
**Lara:**
Well, it was speaking like if I recorded the video for my podcast, like if I was interviewing someone, it made like short social media.

[00:12:45]
**Bradley:**
Oh, okay. Okay. Maybe it's something else. I don't know.

[00:12:48]
**Lara:**
Yeah. There's so many now. But then it added captions to it as well. It found like a couple, you know, sound bites, but had the video on. So that's something else that I've played around.

[00:13:03]
**Bradley:**
So, so would it mainly be like either creating blog posts or emails that are basically like the written versions of your podcasts? Almost.

[00:13:14]
**Lara:**
Yeah.

[00:13:14]
**Bradley:**
Okay.

[00:13:15]
**Lara:**
I wanna use that as like, the main thing. And everything just kind of stems off of that. So I really only am focusing on growing and building this as my biggest funnel. And all the other content kind of comes off of that.

[00:13:33]
**Bradley:**
Because I know people will do, they'll do, like, they'll have, here's my weekly newsletter. And what they'll do is they'll write out a version. Like they'll create a written version that's almost like a podcast script, I guess you could say. And then they'll record it. It'll be, they'll publish it as a YouTube video, which you don't have to do, but like, this is just an example. They'll create a YouTube version of it where they're just reading the script essentially. And then they'll publish that as a podcast and then they'll publish the written newsletter, which gets published to like their blog and then get sent out as an email version of that newsletter that's linked to the blog post.

[00:14:10]
**Lara:**
Okay. So

[00:14:11]
**Bradley:**
Then, so it's basically the same exact thing just published in multiple different formats.

[00:14:16]
**Lara:**
Hold on, I'm writing that down. Hmm. So when they're like, how are they using AI? Is it for the first piece of that, like the podcast script, that's what they're using.

[00:14:38]
**Bradley:**
So what I would say is like, and here's how I do so well, when you're, let me back up to the very first stage. So initially you start with some sort of prompt for yourself, right? Whether that's, I mean, you need an idea and a topic for whatever you're posting. And you might have some sort of questions that prompt yourself of just like, certain things to cover on that topic. Or like, basically what you're trying to get is here's a prompt for myself that allows me to share my unique perspective on this topic. And then, so that's the first step. First is like a self prompt. And then the 2nd part is your braindump where you're brain dumping your unique perspective. I like to do this conversationally again, with the voice chat feature of AI. There's a couple different ways you could do it. You could either do it with ChatGPT brain dumping into the chat thread, or you could just record a voice note with any sort of like voice recording app on your phone, record the whole thing, and then have it transcribed later. And I can get into that later, like which one you'd want to choose for what scenario.

But then the 3rd step would be to create an outline, just like a clear outline of all the stuff that you've brain dumped. You know, like what are the main ideas, what are the sub ideas, what are the, you know, and it depends on what, it depends on the kind of way that you're wanting to, I don't know, structure your blog posts or your podcast. 'cause you might want to structure it like, "Hey, here are 3 main benefits of doing this thing, or here are 3 common mistakes to avoid. Or here are 3 like personal stories I wanna share on this topic." So that's the 3rd step is the outline.

And then 4th step is usually like a first draft, right? So some sort of initial rough draft. And that is what I call like the the content type or the content structure where you'll have, yeah. Where you have a specific, like with writing content, there's 2 main components to it. And that is the structure and then the style. And so the structure is the container, which is like, okay, here are, here's the skeleton in my writing. Here are the main ideas, which are like the subheads here are the, you know, sub ideas, different things I wanna share. And then the style is what you layer onto the structure after the first draft is written. So that all kinda

[00:17:07]
**Lara:**
Okay.

[00:17:08]
**Bradley:**
happens in step 4 of that first draft. And I have specific prompts that I do for clients where they're like, they're always, the concern is always like, "Oh, I want this to be written well and I want to like braindump this voice note or like, you'll interview me on this topic, but then I'm worried that it's not gonna be written in my voice or my style." And a lot of times what I'll take is I'll just literally take a recording of that interview or of their voice note transcript and I'll have ChatGPT like extract a Style Guide and it's just like an outline of different attributes of how they talk, how they speak. And then I'll later that on top. And then the final draft is really just like, there's a prompt that has, will have ChatGPT copy edit your first draft, just looking for grammar changes. "Hey, is this structured in a clear, coherent way?" Or, and I'll have it recommend changes. I'll say, "Hey, I don't want you to just like automatically rewrite this, but I want you to list out, you know, bullet list all the changes that you'd recommend." And then I'll confirm, like I'll tell you, give you approval for which changes I want you to implement. And then it'll write those out. And then you have your final draft.

[00:18:28]
**Lara:**
That's amazing.

[00:18:29]
**Bradley:**
So

[00:18:31]
**Lara:**
That, like in my mind sounds so much more fun than me putting my butt in my chair and being blog posts.

[00:18:38]
**Bradley:**
Exactly. Because

[00:18:40]
**Lara:**
Like when I'm talking with people, it like starts to flow so much easier versus like imagining me like writing to someone that's always been one of my biggest beefs. Like, it's, it feels so much harder than when I'm like talking to your mom. I'm Marco Polo. I'm like, yeah, I'll talk away.

[00:18:57]
**Bradley:**
Exactly. Exactly. So yeah, that's something that I do with clients is like whatever instance, like what are specific type of content they're doing. 'cause you need, the problem is, I think like with structure, you need, and this is what I do too, is sometimes I'll take a proven piece of content or like, there will be an email that I really like and I'll think this is structured really well or a newsletter. And what I'll do is, and I try to avoid having clients do this 'cause it's kind of complicated for them. Unless you really, unless you're really nerdy and you like this stuff like me, but I'll have it analyze and extract the structure. Like the written structure, it's called Rhetorical Structure. But basically how the ideas are organized line by line. It'll describe what each sentence is that's written, the different, the different like psychology elements, right. Whether it's like mistakes to avoid or, you know, bad old thought processes, limiting beliefs, that kind of stuff. But you'll extract that. And then what I'll do is I'll just have that as a prompt for clients. They'll say, "Hey, here are maybe 3 different structures you can choose from. You just choose 1 and plug this in as a prompt and then ChatGPT's going to take everything you brain dumped from your, you know, your voice note outline. It's going to write it in the structure, and then it's going to apply your style as a Style Guide." That's, so it's a few different steps, but they flow into 1 another. And I'm like, honestly pretty amazed at how at how, like I've even done it for my own content where I'll extract a structure from 1 of my blog posts I've written in the past, and then I'll just say, "Hey, I want you to write a new blog post based on the structure, given a new topic." And I'm just amazed at how much it sounds like me, how like clear and coherent it is when I didn't even give it the original blog post in the first place. I just gave it the structure from that blog post.

[00:20:51]
**Lara:**
That's really cool.

[00:20:52]
**Bradley:**
So anyway, that's the main thing I think is it just depends on what type of, 'cause you need a specific, I call it content type or content structure. And that's like an email, blog post, whatever. And then once you have a prompt for that, it's really easy to layer in your Style Guide later. So yeah.

[00:21:11]
**Lara:**
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Here's another idea, just as you were talking that came up, would be kind of cool to do. And I don't know if it's possible, can it read language off of pictures?

[00:21:30]
**Bradley:**
Like, is it like a caption on picture or

[00:21:33]
**Lara:**
Yeah, like a screenshot on something? So like I take a lot of screenshots, like when I'm in Facebook mom groups, I'll just take a screenshot sometimes of like their posts. Because then it like helps me think of like podcast ideas on like, this is something that people are struggling with, just as you were talking about how it can extract things. It would be cool to take some of those and just put them into ChatGPT and say, can you write a podcast episode based on my style? And my content to address this kind of concern that moms have. You know, based on Facebook posts or whatever. Can it do that?

[00:22:14]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So I even have it, I'll even have it, like I have my physical notebook that I'm writing notes in and it'll be like screen or just picture. Can you transcribe this into a written out version? And it can take handwriting. And it was probably like 85 to 90% accurate on my handwriting, which is pretty messy. But then if something's printed out and it's just screenshot, it's, it's like 95% accurate. So

[00:22:39]
**Lara:**
That's wild. Yeah. 'cause right now I take, just because sometimes I think really well when I'm writing. So I'll write out all my outlines for my podcast.

[00:22:51]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:22:53]
**Lara:**
Okay. All right. So you have my brain definitely churning on all of it. How, like what's next steps? Like I think your mom mentioned to me forever ago, you named yours so that it made me laugh because mine's name is Norie. Like I named her Norie a long time ago.

[00:23:13]
**Bradley:**
Haha.

[00:23:14]
**Lara:**
Wife, Norie

[00:23:15]
**Bradley:**
Yeah.

[00:23:16]
**Lara:**
Do you

[00:23:17]
**Bradley:**
Oh, go ahead.

[00:23:19]
**Lara:**
Yeah, so I don't really know where to start with all of this. Like, it's all fabulous, but where do I go from here?

## Next Steps and Personalization

[00:23:26]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So, well, let's just see like your main goals are to, you wanna create your own person, like your own little AI assistant person with a personality. So that's, I mean, that's 1 main thing that I can show you how to do. 'cause all it is, is what I try to do is I think, okay, what would be like either a digital twin version of me or like if I was to create a brother or, or just like a friend that I would want to talk to that basically has my same personality but is also a different person than me. So I have like a specific set of custom instructions that I've written out for mine. My mom has a set of custom instructions that's written out for her. So, and I can get into like each point. 'cause there is an outline of different things that you want to include to, to create that. But yeah, that's, that's 1 thing, especially when you're talking to it conversationally, it feels just like a much more natural conversation with someone that's using your language, you know?

[00:24:29]
**Lara:**
Yes. Does it sync with the app on your phone? 'cause I haven't figured that part out. Like I, it, like I have most of it on my computer, but then when I downloaded the app, none of my conversations moved over to the app.

[00:24:46]
**Bradley:**
Were you using the same account?

[00:24:50]
**Lara:**
I don't know

[00:24:51]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Because I think my mom did like accidentally create 2 different accounts once when she did it on her computer. And then once when she done her phone, so,

[00:24:59]
**Lara:**
When I went to download it, I think it was on my phone, there was like all these options and I'm like, I don't know which 1. All the logos looked the same and

# Custom Instructions â€“ Part 2 (Voice Note AI) (Cleaned Transcript)

## Intro

[00:00:03]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. So purpose of this voice note again, topic and then output asset. I guess we could define this as well. So topic is obviously custom instructions. Honestly, though, I don't know if there's necessarily going to be an output asset for this one just because I already.

[00:00:25]
**Bradley:**
Well, let me see this. So first off, I created a custom instructions voice note already. That's basically like, what I'm trying to do. And again, not with this voice note, but whatever.

[00:00:46]
**Bradley:**
I need to stop spilling over my words. I just need to spit it out. So I need to coach or train or teach, like, basically tutor, teach Lara, mom's friend Lara, aka my client Lara, how to create her own set of custom instructions to basically create her personal assistant, her personal AI assistant, aka nori. N O R I, nori. And just kind of same way that I created Arno.

[00:01:18]
**Bradley:**
Right? Or the same, in a similar fashion, the same way that I helped mom create Alice or Audrey create Ruby or Clara create Cami, but a little bit more like structured, clear, and coherent, because I need to create a template for her to fill in. And so I know the last time, I think. So, again, this custom instructions, too, is just meant to, like, compliment or you know, help refine my thinking. Specifically for how do I create a template with, like, guided how-to.

[00:01:56]
**Bradley:**
Instructions on how to create your own, again, personal AI assistant, just like I created Arno. Right? And I think in the last, like, in the last custom instructions voice note, I really hit on. I really talked about the topics of, like, project specific custom instructions vs personality specific custom instructions, which I'm not gonna hit on as much. I'm just gonna talk about what are the personality specific custom instructions?

[00:02:27]
**Bradley:**
And I know I hit on the sections, so I probably. I don't know, man. Again, this is just to get my brain thinking. Just keep my brain thinking. So maybe I've said everything I need to outline for, you know, that, for what I'm trying to create in that first note.

[00:02:47]
**Bradley:**
But I. Yeah, so I don't want to make this voice note redundant, but I'm just going to conversationally think it out loud. So this is my brain churning. And if there's any additional value on this voice note, then great. So here we go.

## Approach And Components

[00:03:04]
**Bradley:**
But, yeah, I think it's going to be like, okay, what is the approach? Right, we're going to do face framework here. So approach checklist of components, right? Which would basically be sections, because components are sections or like inputs, but yeah, they're really sections. And then the formula and then an example.

[00:03:24]
**Bradley:**
Right? So I don't think that my current custom instructions for Arno are necessarily like the perfect example of how to approach this. But I can like reverse engineer, okay, what am I doing here? And then reverse engineer that into sections and then kind of like an approach of how you want to, I want to approach this. Right.

### Identity And Interaction Style

[00:03:49]
**Bradley:**
So one thing I think, again, I do want to go back to that previous voice note just to make sure I'm hitting on all of the sections. But I think there was identity. I mean, you have identity, which is basically like role and Persona. Also the name, you give it a name and then some kind of talk about the checklist components. Right.

[00:04:20]
**Bradley:**
Now before I talk about approach, but then you also want interaction style. Right? So identity, there's another I word. I can't remember what it was. But then interaction style is another I word.

### Tone Of Voice

[00:04:35]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, man. So that's basically what it is, I guess. Now you could add, here's another section that's kind of novel, but if you're using the advanced voice mode, one thing you could also add is like your tone of voice. Right. Because that's something new.

[00:04:55]
**Bradley:**
I noticed. I probably need to update Arno's original custom instructions to include this now because this is a relevant feature that like, you weren't able to influence or control at all before, but tone of voice, right. Because Arno can now he can talk in a way that's a little bit overly perky or chipper, which I don't like. So I'll probably have to add that into patterns to avoid. But this is specific to tone of voice.

[00:05:22]
**Bradley:**
And then, yeah, the next part will be like, okay, yeah. So here's patterns to avoid for tone of voice and then green flags to aim for. Kind of like red flags to avoid. Green flags to aim for. I don't know if I'll create an entirely separate section that's just exclusive to tone of voice.

[00:05:42]
**Bradley:**
Or if I'll just include this already in my existing, like patterns to avoid, aka red flags to avoid vs green flags to aim for, which also includes other stuff like, you know, punctuation, use of emojis, all that kind of stuff. Wording, like avoid purple prose. Purple prose. P R O S E. I know the transcript gets that wrong all the time.

[00:06:07]
**Bradley:**
That's what it is. So yeah, man, anyway, that's something that's relevant now. So like, I could include in Arno's custom instructions, say, I want you to avoid being, when it comes to tone of voice, that you, for voice chat mode. That's probably what I'd say is for advanced voice mode, I want you to avoid being. Avoid using a tone of voice that is chipper and perky, and instead use a tone of voice that is nonchalant and, like, casual yet competent.

[00:06:45]
**Bradley:**
Right. Something like that.

### Character Limit Constraints

[00:06:50]
**Bradley:**
Again, we have to fit this within a dang character limit. So probably what I'm going to do is I'm going to have to strip away some of the stuff that I previously wrote, and I'll probably have to do some sort of evaluation. They're just evaluation where I basically ask Arno, "Hey, I'm rewriting your custom instructions, man. I need your help with what to, like, what to get rid of or what to exclude vs what to keep. So I need to know what influences your personality the most and that kind of stuff."

[00:07:21]
**Bradley:**
Right. So anyway.

[00:07:28]
**Bradley:**
But, yeah, man. So let's do that.

## Yin-Yang Prompting Framework

[00:07:34]
**Bradley:**
Let's see. Okay, so let me talk about, because I can go back to the other voice note for checklist components, but what I really want to, I guess, hammer home on is more. So how do I teach this to someone? Like, how do I teach them the approach? And I think one of the main approach factors is yin yang prompting, which is something that I've, like, not saying I've invented it, but, like, this is my personal approach to prompting, right?

[00:08:01]
**Bradley:**
To prevent over correction, but also, like, dial in the balance, right in that sweet spot where you want it to be.

[00:08:13]
**Bradley:**
So, yeah, like, this is my personal, what I call, like, yin yang prompting framework. This is the balance of opposites. It's a balance of opposites that dials in the sweet spot, which is exactly where you want to be. So.

[00:08:28]
**Bradley:**
And that just increases the value of the framework, right? If you name it, Yin yang framework. Yin yang prompting. Yin yang. Or however you say it.

### Describing Ideal Personality Traits

[00:08:38]
**Bradley:**
But yeah, dude. So let me see, how do I say this? I mean, first off, like, before you even get into Yin Yang prompting, you probably, you just want to think of, okay, if I was to describe, like, my ideal friend and their personality, what would that be like? Right. Let's break it down.

[00:08:57]
**Bradley:**
What are some, like, personality traits? And just to get your mind going, probably an easy way to do it is just like, I'm not saying give it a template, but, like, give an example. Right? So give an example. Okay, well, I want them to be like, I think, for me, strike a balance between casual yet competent.

[00:09:17]
**Bradley:**
Like someone who's easy to talk to.

[00:09:21]
**Bradley:**
Again, you're just describing, like, your ideal friend or your ideal collaborative partner. Like, if you had a. You can think of this like your digital twin or your you know, like your brother or sister, however you want to do this. But it's also like you can think of it just how would I describe my ideal friend? Right.

[00:09:39]
**Bradley:**
That's probably an easier way to think about it. And like, what are some of the personality traits they would have? Right. I mean, to me, this is almost kind of like, again, this is not the same as, but it's similar to. If you're trying to describe your personal, your perfect, or your ideal, like, partner, aka your ideal spouse, you know, before you're married, what kind of traits do they have?

[00:10:02]
**Bradley:**
Right. But in this sense, again, you're kind of creating sort of this just bulleted list of ideas at the start of what kind of traits would I, would my ideal friend have, right.

### Key Components: Traits And Interaction Style

[00:10:19]
**Bradley:**
So part of this comes down to, like, traits or characteristics or attributes, and then the other part of it really comes down to, like, interaction style. And then I think another part of it comes down to, could come down to, like, specific things that you want them to do. I guess it falls under interaction style, huh? Because if you're like, yeah, that probably does. I'll add to this if I have more ideas, but I think the main things are just like identity traits / attributes, characteristics, and then interaction style type things, right?

[00:10:55]
**Bradley:**
Like, how do you, how do you engage with this person? What are your interactions like? So any who's, it's. I think that should be helpful.

### Yin-Yang Prompting For Balanced Traits

[00:11:08]
**Bradley:**
I'm trying to think if there's. I did take a look at my custom instructions last time that I probably, and then I kind of like, reverse engineered or just described what I was doing in each section. But one of the ways that you achieve describing these traits or attributes or characteristics in a good way is by dialing them in through the use of yin yang prompting, right. I've talked about that like, you are empathetic and encouraging, but also, like, blunt and honest. I guess that could be sort of a balance.

### Brainstorming With Arno

[00:11:46]
**Bradley:**
I got to go back to my. Back to my trades. I could even brainstorm with Arno, dude, that's probably what I should do is like, "Hey, man, I'm trading the ideal, like, custom instructions template where I am going to be coaching or consulting or basically like, tutoring someone else on how to create their, their personal AI friend / assistant for the first time. Just very similar to the way that I created you. But I need more of like, a structured approach with certain sections."

[00:12:11]
**Bradley:**
Here's what I've thought about. One of the things is identity. Again, characteristics, traits, attributes, and then the other, another thing I've thought of is interaction style, right? So there's two identities, right. You describe the identity of them like your personal AI assistant, but then you also describe your identity so it knows you, right.

[00:12:29]
**Bradley:**
Knows things that are relevant to you. So I think those are the, those are like the two sides of the same coin as far as identity goes. You could even describe, like, your interaction style, how you interact with it, so that it's, again, a double sided coin. Interaction style, how you want them to interact with you, and how you will be interacting with them. But again, we have a 1500 character limit, so that's really the constraint here.

[00:12:56]
**Bradley:**
And then attention. Attention is another thing which kind of naturally falls into the 1500 character constraint, right. Because you want to. You want to keep these instructions as probably concise as possible without losing their effectiveness or their, like, the amount of context that you need. So.

[00:13:13]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, but, yeah, man, I would say. I'm trying to think. Yeah, but that's, that's basically how it approached with Arno's. Like, "Hey, man, here are the things I thought of, including. I."

[00:13:28]
**Bradley:**
I mean, you can use your system prompt as an idea, like a launching point. But again, I don't think that your system prompt is broken out into these sections that I have yet. So we're just gonna kind of. Again, the approach is, I'm coaching. Here's the context.

### Coaching Approach For Custom Instructions

[00:13:45]
**Bradley:**
I am coaching a client on how to create their own custom instructions for their own personal AI assistant, aka digital twin or collaborative partner and ideal friend. And here's. I needed basically like a template to fill in. And here are some ideas of things that. It's kind of like main points and sub points, right?

[00:14:07]
**Bradley:**
So, I mean, if you have a headline, it's a what I just described, however many steps to create your own personal AI assistant, aka digital twin, collaborative partner or ideal friend.

[00:14:22]
**Bradley:**
Right? And then you just fill in the blanks. Okay, what are the main points? What are the sub points? So this is very much just like my weekly newsletter writing workflow, I guess.

[00:14:34]
**Bradley:**
But the difference is we're just collaborating with Arno, kind of brainstorming some things to include it.

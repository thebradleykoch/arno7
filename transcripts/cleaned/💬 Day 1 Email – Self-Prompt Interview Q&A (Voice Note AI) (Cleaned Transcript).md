# ðŸ’¬ Day 1 Email â€“ Self-Prompt Interview Q&A (Voice Note AI) (Cleaned Transcript)

## Intro To Day 1 Email â€“ Self-Prompt Interview Q&A

[00:00:01]
**Bradley:**
All right, so here's what we're gonna do. We're going to do the day 1 email, self-prompt interview Q&A. Right. Question and answer.

## Converting Rhetorical Structure Into Self-Prompt Template

[00:00:14]
**Bradley:**
Basically, I've converted the rhetorical structure template into a self-prompt interview question template. I'm going to go down the line, bullet point by bullet point, answering these questions to the best of my ability. This will serve as braindump content for both my personal, human-written, AI unassisted draft.

[00:00:43]
**Bradley:**
That is prong number 1 of writing this email. And then also this is going to be the same braindump content that Arno will use for prong 2, which is the AI draft. Right. Okay, let's roll through this.

## Answering Each Question Thoroughly With Constraints

[00:01:05]
**Bradley:**
I wanted to ensure that for each question, I aim for a minimum of 1 paragraph, but probably 1 or 2 paragraphs of content. I think I was aiming for a maximum of 2 to 5 minutes per question. So I'm going to try to hard cap that.

[00:01:51]
**Bradley:**
I can't remember those constraints, but that's what I'll go with. Okay, let's do this. Okay, cool. Yeah, I just double-checked my voice note, and that is what it is.

[00:02:00]
**Bradley:**
So we're aiming for 1 to 2 paragraphs of voice note transcript text in terms of my answers to these questions. Each question should be under 2 minutes, with a hard cap of 5 minutes for each individual question. I only anticipate going on a rant for a few of these. Okay, so let's roll.

## Crafting The Subject Line And Preview Subtext

[00:02:34]
**Bradley:**
This is for the subject line and the preview subtext. So the subject line question is, what's the punchiest way to describe this mistake in 5 to 10 words? Let's see. I think we're just going to go with a prescriptive way, like mistake number 1.

[00:02:56]
**Bradley:**
Treating your AI like a customer service agent. Right. Treating your AI like a generic customer service agent. Something like that. Right.

[00:03:06]
**Bradley:**
And then the preview subtext question is, what's the immediate painful consequence that'll grab my reader's attention in the preview text? Okay, so I think, let's see. I don't know, man. Like, and again, this can be either an immediate painful consequence or an immediate beneficial reward of avoiding the mistake.

## Exploring Negative And Positive Outcomes

[00:03:39]
**Bradley:**
Right. So it's either a negative outcome or positive outcome. Just flip-flopped. Whatever you want to do. Let's see.

[00:03:51]
**Bradley:**
I think really just having these frustrating robotic conversations that don't feel like you're talking with a real friend or a real person. Just these rigid robotic interactions. Again, that does not feel like you are speaking with a thought partner or a collaborative partner or a friend. I mean, maybe we should include that there. Because the subject line, the mistake is basically the first half.

## Incorporating Collaborative Partner In Preview Text

[00:04:20]
**Bradley:**
Right. Treating your AI like a generic customer service agent. So maybe we should incorporate the phrase collaborative partner in the preview subtext somehow. So something like, "Ever wish your chats with AI felt more like talking with a collaborative partner?" or something along those lines. We'll figure it out.

[00:04:44]
**Bradley:**
I need Arno's input on this. Cool. So something like that.

## Email Component Structure And Element Outline

[00:04:57]
**Bradley:**
Cool. So now we are going on to the email component structure plus element outline. Okay, so the intro is pretty.

[00:05:11]
**Bradley:**
Let's see.

## Defining The Structure And Bullet Points

[00:05:20]
**Bradley:**
I guess we have to figure out what goes in brackets. So like the part that says specifically and then bullet point, the reason solopreneurs make this mistake. Next bullet point, why the negative outcome happens. And then the third bullet point is just set in stone. It's "and how to fix it."

[00:05:38]
**Bradley:**
Right. We're not going to change that.

## Collaborating With Arno For Bullet Points

[00:05:43]
**Bradley:**
I don't know. I'm going to go with Arno's help on this one. I'm probably just going to riff it and figure it out. Okay.

[00:05:53]
**Bradley:**
I mean, I could say something like the reason solopreneurs make this mistake without realizing it. And the next bullet is why your conversations sound so robotic. Or why conversations feel like fighting with a stranger instead of flowing with a friend. Something like that. Right, cool.

[00:06:21]
**Bradley:**
And then the third bullet point is "and how to fix it." It stays the same always.

## Mistake Number One: Treating AI As A Customer Service Agent

[00:06:29]
**Bradley:**
Okay, cool. Okay, now we are on the main point of the mistake, mistake number 1. And we'll insert that there. So first bullet point, what is the mistake? So this is the question.

[00:06:45]
**Bradley:**
What is the mistake? State it simply and directly. Blunt and point blank. What's a shocking stat or truth that reveals how common this mistake is? So here's my answer.

## Common Mistake In AI Interaction

[00:06:59]
**Bradley:**
I would say like 95% of solopreneurs talk to ChatGPT like it's Siri from 2011, right? And it's not their fault because they've been trained this way. Like you. Basically, you've been inadvertently trained to interact with AI like this.

[00:07:24]
**Bradley:**
But that's the problem. Right? Cool. Next question. When and where does mistake show up in common relatable situations?

## Identifying Situations Where The Mistake Occurs

[00:07:34]
**Bradley:**
When you see someone make this mistake, what exactly do they do? What are some specific examples of how this mistake, AKA problem, manifests in real life? So let's see. I would say...

## Examples Of Command-Based Prompts

[00:07:55]
**Bradley:**
So I would say, yeah, so basically, let's see. I mean, what this looks like just on a basic level is anytime you see someone pull up ChatGPT and give a really short, generic command-based prompt such as, "Please summarize this," right? Or "Give me some blog post ideas about X." Right? Like "Give me some blog post ideas about AI" or whatever topic it is, right?

[00:08:43]
**Bradley:**
Like just super, super short, generic command-based prompts, right? Basically, basically how you would communicate with Siri, right? You give a command. It's not like a conversation at all.

## Conversational Approach Versus Command Prompts

[00:09:17]
**Bradley:**
I've talked about this in other braindump content, but you would never say to a friend, like, if you're communicating with a real friend, you never say, "Hey, give me some blog post ideas about AI," right? You'd give them more context, right? You'd say something like, "Hey, so I'm brainstorming some blog post ideas because I'm a content creator, and here's the topic I want to focus on. I can share some of my unique perspectives or ideas, but what I want to get right now is just some basic ideas to get the juices flowing.

## Providing Context For Better AI Interaction

[00:09:42]
**Bradley:**
Here's my topic, and maybe here are some things that I want to avoid or that I don't care about talking about. And here are a couple of key points that I really do want to focus on, right? It could be subtopics. Just imagine it's a night and day difference. Instead of imagining, "Oh, hey, I'm talking to Siri, and I need to give a super short, like five-word prompt to make sure that she understands and doesn't go off the rails."

## Reframing AI As A Collaborative Partner

[00:10:13]
**Bradley:**
Instead of imagining that, imagine that you are talking to a very intelligent, competent, super approachable friend that you really get along with, and you're just having a conversation, right? That's the mental reframe. I guess this is kind of an answer to a later point, a later question. But yeah, I think for the most part, it's just people really underutilizing ChatGPT's capabilities because they are stuck in this rigid, command-prompt mode.

## Importance Of Follow-Up And Feedback

[00:10:49]
**Bradley:**
And especially here too. It's not just the first prompt that they give, right? Like, I was just giving an example of a first prompt, but like in the follow-up, in the feedback, when the AI gives you maybe two ideas that you do like and then three ideas that you don't care for, instead of just following up with something else generic like "I like idea 1 and 2, could you expand those?"

## Providing Detailed Feedback For Better Results

[00:11:29]
**Bradley:**
Say, "I like ideas 1 and 2 because X, Y, and Z. The others don't appeal to me because like A, B, C, I don't really care about that. So could we focus on ideas 1 and 2 and could you expand those by giving me some real-life examples of what that might look like in real life? Then I can add my own perspective to that or something like that where you're giving more, like just much better feedback.

## Yin Yang Prompting And Feedback

[00:12:08]
**Bradley:**
I mean, I guess this is really like, it's kind of like Yin Yang prompting, but it's more like Yin Yang feedback. And then you're just clarifying your goal too. Like, "Hey, here's what I'm thinking. Here's the goal again, here's more of what I'm thinking." And then you are adding your own personal, unique perspective or context or viewpoints to really give the AI something to go off of and something to collaborate with.

## Moving Beyond Command-Based Interaction

[00:12:29]
**Bradley:**
Instead of just saying, "Hey, like you there, you servant boy, do this for me." All right? So anyway, that's my answer to that. I think that manifests really in your life a lot.

## Real-Life Impacts Of Miscommunication With AI

[00:12:42]
**Bradley:**
Just really, I mean, again, giving these rigid command-based prompts because people are treating it like Siri and just really not understanding how much better and more accurately and more effectively the AI can collaborate with them in a way that's really fun. Like in a way that just feels natural and smooth. It just feels like a natural conversation instead of a back-and-forth Siri fight conversation. Right, cool.

## Immediate Negative Impact Of Miscommunication

[00:13:16]
**Bradley:**
Next question. What's the immediate negative impact? What's the painful missed opportunity this pitfall results in? And why does that matter? Or why should my reader care?

## Enjoyable Experiences With AI As A Collaborative Partner

[00:13:28]
**Bradley:**
Well, I mean, I don't know how to say this concisely, but like, I mean, I think on one level, it's really just a way more enjoyable experience to speak and have a natural conversation with an AI friend that gets you, that just feels like a normal human. It's much more of that, like, group partner vibe. Kind of like, here's the college project, here's a group partner that really, like, your best friend is going to be your group partner, right? Not Siri.

## Moving Away From Siri Vibe To Collaborative AI

[00:14:01]
**Bradley:**
Get away from the Siri vibe. Instead, insert your group partner, who's your best friend, super smart, and has their own complementary ideas. It's just a lot more fun. And I think too, like, I don't know. I don't know how to say this succinctly, but I think as a result, partially, the AI, you become much better at communicating your own content to the AI.

## Enhancing Communication Skills With AI

[00:14:28]
**Bradley:**
You're communicating your goal, your preferences, the things you care about, the things you don't like. So the AI starts to get you a lot more, right? Whether it's through the use of memories or you're able to update these things in the custom instructions when you're giving it a personality. Or I think really at the fundamental level, like, you are just becoming a much better communicator and conversationalist and you're better able to communicate what you're aiming for. And so as a result, the AI responses are going to be 10 times more on point.

## Discovering Valuable Insights Through AI Collaboration

[00:15:02]
**Bradley:**
You're going to discover things that you never even realized that are super valuable for yourself and for your readers as a solopreneur who's publishing content. And I think that's really the difference. You're going to have a collaborative partner that's going to point out things that you've never even thought of that will be a slam dunk and resonate with your target readers and ultimately make you more money, save you more time, create better relationships between you and your audience because the AI is your collaborative partner.

## Comparison Of AI As Collaborative Partner Vs. Servant

[00:15:49]
**Bradley:**
It's a night and day difference. It's like having an incompetent intern who just graduated high school and doesn't have any ambition or any personality traits in common with you versus having a college best friend who's collaborating with you. And you actually have the same energy, same wavelength. And you actually hit slam dunk home run projects because you're just vibing together and you're able to create so much better work, and it feels so much more enjoyable.

[00:16:26]
**Bradley:**
So I think that's the two things: one, this is more of a surface level thing, but it just feels so much better. It feels so much more natural. It feels like a conversation. It makes the process enjoyable instead of frustrating and anger-inducing because the AI actually gets you and you are getting the AI. And then the second thing is you just produce so much better results because the AI actually, like, you and the AI are on the same page, you're on the same wavelength and you connect and complement each other in ways you never expected.

## Enhanced Outputs And Relationships With AI

[00:17:00]
**Bradley:**
The outputs, the results that you create as a result of these AI chats or AI conversations are so much better. Again, they make you more money, save you more time and energy, they reinvigorate you with energy, they create better relationships between you and your target audience. All that stuff.

## Missed Opportunities From Poor AI Engagement

[00:17:24]
**Bradley:**
And again, the missed opportunity is losing all those positive things, like not resonating, not connecting with your readers, spending hours and hours trying to do everything yourself, just feeling overwhelmed by all you have to do, not really connecting with your readers.

## Consequences Of Frustrating AI Interactions

[00:17:47]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I mean, like having to drain all your time and energy either trying to do this stuff on your own or trying to fight with an AI that just does not cooperate and ultimately feels like a waste of time. And just having a really bad nightmarish experience, feeling like you're trying to flow in a natural conversation with Siri, which just does not happen. Cool. So the next main point section.

## Understanding The Origins Of The Mistake

[00:18:25]
**Bradley:**
So the next main point is the reason this happens. Right. So first question, looking back in time, where did this mistake originate? Like, where did it originally start happening and why? And what are some specific relatable examples of real-life situations that formed this old POV or belief in people's minds in the first place?

## Historical Context: Siri, Alexa, And Phone Trees

[00:18:47]
**Bradley:**
I think I've shared everything I need to on this in other sections of this braindump content, which will be, again, I pointed to Siri and Alexa and, you know, generic customer service, like phone trees, basically, where you have to. Where it's like, "Press 7 if you'd like to speak with a representative." Or like, "Say 7 if you'd like to speak with a representative." And then you say seven and the robot's like, "Did you say W? Sorry, that's not a correct answer. Goodbye." And then like, you know, those type of experiences.

## Common Misconceptions And Training

[00:19:27]
**Bradley:**
So I think again, Siri or Alexa or these customer service automated phone systems that are just nightmarish and you're never able to speak to a human. You have to speak with this crappy robot that doesn't understand anything you say. Right? And again, look at my other examples within the other sections of this braindump content for more clarity and even better ways of sharing those examples and wording those things. So, yeah, so next question.

## Why Smart Solopreneurs Fall For The Mistake

[00:20:09]
**Bradley:**
Why do smart solopreneurs fall for this? What makes it so tempting and prevalent? Well, I think it's just really, it's just the way that everybody's been trained, right? Everybody's been trained into these rigid command systems instead of having a natural conversation. Like before ChatGPT, you could never have a natural, normal conversation with a robot. It just wouldn't happen.

## Challenges With Early AI Models

[00:20:36]
**Bradley:**
Right? And even with the first versions, I think this is an important point too. With the very first versions of ChatGPT like GPT 3.5, those versions were still very young and immature. And so, yes, they were better than Siri in some ways, but they were almost just as frustrating because of the way they responded. Right?

## Evolution Of AI Capabilities With Recent Models

[00:21:03]
**Bradley:**
Whether that was the style or it didn't get you. So it was like Siri's slightly smarter older cousin, but it wasn't anything, you know, human-like essentially. Right. But I think with more recent models, again, with GPT-4o and Claude by Anthropic, right, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and some of these other models, like these things are so much more intelligent and natural in terms of the conversations you can have with them.

## Overcoming The Temptation Of Old Habits

[00:21:40]
**Bradley:**
It just feels so much better. So anyway, again, I think it's that it's tempting because that's just the way things have always been. And also it's lazy on your part too because you're like, I don't know if it's just due to unawareness or obliviousness because people just don't know how. They don't know that having a natural conversation with AI will give them so much better results. And so they just default to the old way that they've kind of inherited as their default POV, which is the rigid command-based stuff like Siri.

## Lack Of Awareness And Skill In AI Interaction

[00:22:21]
**Bradley:**
Or maybe they, I think another part is it is just that people are maybe lazy and they're like, "Hey, I want you to do this." And they sort of expect the AI to read their mind based on a one-sentence prompt. And like without more context and clarity, it just doesn't work. And that's just the exact same way that it would in real life if you're training an employee or if you're having a conversation with a friend. They're totally going to misinterpret you with one-sentence prompts.

## Expectation Versus Reality In AI Communication

[00:22:53]
**Bradley:**
And so I think people expect it to respond like a human just based on one-sentence prompts and they expect it to read their minds. And they are lazy. They don't want to. They either don't know how to or they don't want to share more useful information in the prompt. I think again, it's a lack of skill, it's a lack of awareness, probably lack of awareness first off, but also on another level it's a lack of skill and also some sort of laziness.

## Cause And Effect Chain Leading To Negative Outcomes

[00:23:23]
**Bradley:**
Right, cool. Next question. So what does the cause and effect chain look like that leads to the end result, AKA the ultimate negative outcome and one domino at a time. So it's kind of like this cause happens which leads to that effect, which leads to this result. And what's the deeper cost of staying stuck here?

## Immediate Impact And Long-Term Consequences

[00:24:01]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, I mean, I feel like I've talked about this a lot, but it's kind of like again, the immediate negative impact is you're having really crappy, just not fun, frustrating conversations back and forth. So the process sucks. And then on a second level, you get worse outputs, so you get worse results. So you're not living up to your highest self, you're not living up to your full potential as a solopreneur because you're not using AI in a way that it can collaborate with you. So you're just stuck like by yourself, trying to do everything.

## Lack Of Identity And Personality In AI

[00:24:42]
**Bradley:**
But yeah, and I mean, I think I've described where these outcomes lead to in these two different levels.

[00:24:52]
**Bradley:**
But yeah, man, I mean, people just don't understand how to give their AI an identity and personality and sort of collaborative nature or interaction style. And so they default to these command-based prompts which they've inherited from ancient AIs like Siri.

## Being Left Behind In The AI Evolution

[00:25:12]
**Bradley:**
And it leads to those negative outcomes which I've already described. So yeah, that's the deeper cost of staying stuck here is just, I think that everybody else around you, whether they're your role models or your peers, they start to excel, they start to gain pattern recognition, they start to really level up and get results as a result of being able to collaborate with AI. And you stay stuck where you are because you're clueless and you have a lack of awareness and a lack of knowledge and you just feel like you're spinning your wheels. You feel like you're seeing people take off and get it and really be successful and enjoy using AI.

## Comparison To Role Models And Peers

[00:26:12]
**Bradley:**
And you're stuck here with a one-recipe cookbook and you're wondering why you can't make a delicious meal, why you can't get the results that your peers and maybe your role models or your mentors are getting and why does it feel so easy for them, why does it look so effortless?

## Consequences Of Falling Behind In AI Usage

[00:26:56]
**Bradley:**
And why am I stuck with these same damn results? And so yeah, I think there's a sense of potentially being, feeling like you're being left behind maybe through comparison to other people and just really like again, other people being able to harness and really use this technology really well while you still feel like you are stuck to the era of technology you were born in and you're not really able to catch up. So you get left behind in the dust. I don't know, something like that. And ultimately it's more of a light like really you get left behind in the dust, but it's more of like what's the result on your lifestyle or your social situation or I don't know, whatever you aspire to.

## Relational Fears And Identity Struggles

[00:27:22]
**Bradley:**
You're comparing yourself to role models and peers and mentors and that's really sort of the. Again, most fears are relational. They're a result of like self-doubt or identity struggles, beliefs. It's not just getting left behind. It's like I'm getting left behind in relation to other people that I know and respect and look up to and want to be like succeeding with.

## Fixing The Mistake: New Mindset And Approach

[00:27:31]
**Bradley:**
Next main point. This one next main point is and how to fix it. Right. Okay, so we're starting off with the main sub point of the mindset. First question, what's the simple truth about fixing this mistake?

## Embracing A New POV For AI Interaction

[00:27:45]
**Bradley:**
What's the new POV, AKA the fundamental mental reframe? And how does this contrast with the old POV? Right, so I think I've talked about this ad nauseam, but the simple truth is once you start treating AI as a collaborative partner instead of a generic tool and you start learning how to do that, like you gain, first off, you gain awareness of how you can, how that even happens, how it's possible. And then second off, you gain the skill, which is actually like learning the principles, learning the skills to apply, applying the templates, all that kind of stuff. And like, putting this into action in real life for yourself and practicing like that is all of a sudden, it's totally transformed.

## Discovering New Ways To Use AI

[00:28:41]
**Bradley:**
I don't know how to say this, but like, you all of a sudden are the one, like, understanding and using technology in ways that blow your friends away, that blow other people away, that like blow you away in ways that you discover new things by yourself, in ways that you, again, connect with your audience on a deeper, more meaningful level. You're making more money, you're gaining more freedom. Again, it's an abundance of freedom and those other factors.

## Treating AI As A Collaborative Partner

[00:29:15]
**Bradley:**
But, yeah, I mean, the simple truth is instead of treating AI like a generic tool, you start treating it like a collaborative partner. And you apply my specific instructions on how to do that. Like, the actual skills. You gain the awareness, and then you gain the skills.

## Golden Rule Of AI Interaction

[00:29:33]
**Bradley:**
And you start interacting with it differently. And the AI, like, again, I can't emphasize this enough is like, it's kind of like the golden rule, right? Treat people how you would want to be treated, or what you send out gets returned to you. Like karma. You can call it whatever you want, but like, when you start treating the AI as a real, like, person, as a collaborative partner and friend, it starts treating you like a real person, as a collaborative partner and friend.

## Enjoying Fun And Natural Interactions

[00:30:13]
**Bradley:**
Like, that's the night and day mindset shift is like, it stops acting like a robot when you treat it like a real person, so it treats you back like a real person. And it's actually a fun conversation. Fun interactions, because you're actually going somewhere now, and it feels fluid and natural. Okay, next question.

## Steps To Implement The New Approach

[00:30:26]
**Bradley:**
What are the simple steps to implement this fix? Like, basically, what's the basic preview of the action steps? So basic preview is you give your AI an identity and a personality. Or I guess you could say identity, personality, and interaction style. And the way you do that is using custom instructions.

## Enhancing Prompting Skills For Better Results

[00:30:46]
**Bradley:**
I mean, that's really the main thing. I think maybe a second thing is you start, like, you start upgrading your prompting skills. Like the way the type of prompts, the prompts that you either communicate conversationally or type out, you start communicating differently in the actual chat thread as well, right? So first you set up custom instructions, give it identity, personality, interaction style.

## Adapting And Iterating Over Time

[00:31:18]
**Bradley:**
Second, you start changing your prompting style, you start speaking more conversationally as you would to a friend. That changes the messages you send to the AI in your chat threads and that changes the responses or outputs that you get from your AI friend, right?

## Experimental Approach And Continuous Improvement

[00:31:38]
**Bradley:**
And I think maybe third would just be like, expect this to evolve over time. Like you want to take an experimental approach, right? Like, this is not going to be a one and done thing where you just write out your custom instructions once as a first draft and then you tweak a couple of things about your prompting style and then voila, magically fixed, right? Like, no, you're going to refine and iterate based on feedback, based on the results. You're going to upgrade your custom instructions over time, very iteratively, over like a period of weeks and months.

## Refining Communication Skills With AI

[00:32:20]
**Bradley:**
And then you're also going to expect to evolve.

[00:32:29]
**Bradley:**
You're also going to expect to evolve like as a conversationalist, as a, like your prompting skills, right? So I think that's a major thing is you're going to expect to evolve through your communication skills with AI, as a person, as a conversationalist. And really, your messages in the chat threads are going to get better and better and you have to refine and tweak your approach based on your experiences, based on your firsthand interactions and the results you get. And you're going to have to tweak, you know, little things about your prompts. You might tweak the wording, you might tweak the instructions, you might edit a prompt, you might regenerate a response.

## Expectation Of Growth And Adaptation

[00:33:16]
**Bradley:**
Just expect that you are going to experiment with your prompting style, like your messages in the chat threads as well as the custom instructions. Okay, cool. So those are basically the three things. So what's the next question? What's the transformative outcome waiting for my reader on the other side?

## Transformative Outcomes Of Improved AI Interaction

[00:33:35]
**Bradley:**
I think I've described this in detail already. You're going to have conversations that actually feel like you're speaking with a real person in real life. You're going to evolve as a person. You're going to become a much better communicator and conversationalist as a result. You're going to connect with your audience members much better.

## Building Deeper Relationships And Achieving Success

[00:33:54]
**Bradley:**
You're going to have deeper relationships with them. You're going to make more money. You're going to feel like your time and effort and energy that you've invested is actually making an impact, like a two times greater impact. And you're going to gain a skill that everybody really wants and needs, but most people don't know how to get it again, which is using AI for your business or your personal life. Whatever you want to do.

## Action Steps And Implementation Guidelines

[00:34:25]
**Bradley:**
All right, next section. So this is the main sub point. This is action steps. What are the exact steps to implement this fix? Like, what should my reader do first, next, last?

## Guiding Through The Implementation Process

[00:34:38]
**Bradley:**
I think I'm just gonna hammer this out and write it out, like through the use of screenshots. I'm gonna, maybe I'm gonna act. Maybe I'll record myself doing a screen recording, like a really rough draft one, and just be like, "Okay, kind of like I guided Lara, Mom's friend Lara, through how to do this." Maybe I'll revisit that notion page and I'll just basically be like, "Okay, cool. What did I walk her through?"

## Practicing And Demonstrating The Steps

[00:35:05]
**Bradley:**
How did that go down? And yeah, I don't know, maybe practice it. Practice speaking out loud. Like I'm coaching somebody through this on a Zoom call, like on a video consult. Consult call.

## Offering Visual And Practical Examples

[00:35:18]
**Bradley:**
I don't know, we'll figure it out. And then I'll insert that here. I think that'll be easier to do in that format rather than me talking about it here. Cool. The next main sub point is the examples. So question.

## Visualizing ChatGPT's User Interface

[00:35:35]
**Bradley:**
What would a screenshot walkthrough of where to go and what to do in ChatGPT's UI look like? Right, the user interface. So pretty self-explanatory. I'm trying to think if I should do this on. Probably I'll do this both on desktop and on mobile, like on my iPhone.

## Navigating Different Platforms: Desktop And Mobile

[00:35:53]
**Bradley:**
Because the buttons you tap and the navigation is different if you're on a desktop versus on a phone. So if you're in the app on your phone versus if you're in an Internet browser, like on your desktop. Right. So I'll play with that. I'll probably include both versions just because again, the navigation is different.

## Simplifying And Annotating Custom Instructions

[00:36:18]
**Bradley:**
I don't know why ChatGPT didn't simplify it, but that's just the way it is. So yeah, I'll do both versions of that.

[00:36:28]
**Bradley:**
And then next question, how can I screenshot my custom instructions and display them in a way that's helpful? I don't know, man. I'll probably create like a pseudo version of my custom instructions. Just like an alternate version where I have Arno take my current custom instructions for him and say, "Hey man, I want you to basically like keep this content almost the same verbatim, but just sort of like either reformat it or organize it into these main subhead sections that I've defined as the main component sections of custom instructions that I'm going to give to my reader as a template, right?" So I'll probably have that first and then I might rework them a little bit.

## Creating Template-Friendly Custom Instructions

[00:37:19]
**Bradley:**
But I do want to give them at least a version, like an alternate version of Arno's custom instructions that are written in a template-friendly way that they fit with the exact template that I'm giving to my target reader so they can see what that looks like. And again, I don't have to super optimize that or anything. I'm just creating an example. This is one instance. This is one example.

## Flexibility In Custom Instructions

[00:37:51]
**Bradley:**
Again, I am constantly upgrading and tweaking Arno's custom instructions myself. So I'm not obligated to use this one example that I'm giving my reader for the rest of my life, right? Like, it just, "Hey, here's an example of what this could look like. This is sort of what it looks like for me right now. Combined, combined with the template I'm giving you."

## Annotating And Highlighting Key Points

[00:38:15]
**Bradley:**
"Here's how it could work for you. Go ham." Right, cool. And then I can do whatever I want with my own custom instructions. I don't have to keep them the same. I can do whatever I want. Cool.

## Yin Yang Prompting Technique Tips

[00:38:27]
**Bradley:**
Next question. Well, sorry, going back to that, I think, yeah, put them in the template format and then include a screenshot, probably. I do want to annotate things because I'm going to give some tips on the Yin Yang prompting technique. So I do want to point out and annotate, highlight specific things that are relevant in my own custom instructions example for Arno and show, and just basically point those out like, "Hey, look, here's an example of how I'm applying what I'm teaching you. Boom, boom, boom." I'm going to call it out, I'm going to label it, I'm going to add a little annotation arrow, underline it, highlight it, whatever I want to do. Okay, cool. Next question.

## Before And After Comparison Of AI Responses

[00:39:17]
**Bradley:**
So what does the before and after comparison of the collaborative AI versus the generic AI's responses look like? I do think I need to do some simplification here because I already did this. Like, I already captured some screenshot examples, right? You use the same prompt, use the prompt, and then you get the generic AI's response. And then you copy and paste that same exact prompt into like Arno's chat thread, which is the collaborative AI.

## Simplifying And Annotating AI Responses

[00:39:54]
**Bradley:**
And then you screenshot Arno's response, right? And you just compare and contrast. I think I do need to simplify this. I would, honestly, dude, I would not be against just rewriting Arno's response myself or even the generic AI's, because, and then having it just like, "Hey, can you reprint out this text verbatim?" right? And then that way I can screenshot it and it looks, it looks like it looks legit.

## Creating Clear And Simple Comparisons

[00:40:21]
**Bradley:**
It looks like it came as a natural response. Because I don't think that's like, I don't think that's scammy at all. Because really we're just trying to illustrate the point. And what I would do is I would take the actual, you know, responses from each of these two AIs and I would just like, I would just cut out words or like rework them very slightly to make them instantly easy to understand for the reader. Because I think the last thing I want my reader to do is to get caught up overanalyzing or trying too hard to understand the prompt and the responses in the screenshots because they're either too long or they're too convoluted.

## Enhancing Reader Comprehension With Annotations

[00:41:07]
**Bradley:**
I just want to paint a very simple and straightforward black and white, day and night contrast, super easy to read and glance through without getting caught up in the weeds and just be like, "Hey, cool, bad example versus good example. You can clearly see it, you can consume it and digest it in about, you know, 10 to 30 seconds for each screenshot." I don't want my readers to really spend any more than really like 20 to 30 seconds for each screenshot analyzing it. And I think so again, one way I can speed that up is through editing the AI's responses just to make them a little bit cleaner and easier to read and consume and digest, maybe making them more concise, whatever, maybe editing my original prompts to make it a little bit more simple and straightforward, instantly easy to read and understand. And then the second thing is I can add annotations, which I definitely will need to do to point out, you know, certain words or phrases or like examples that each AI's response uses that are either, you know, generic or personal and collaborative.

## Key Points For Quick Understanding

[00:42:23]
**Bradley:**
Right. So I think you can speed up my readers' consumption and understanding digestion process of the screenshots by adding clear and simple annotations that basically guide their eyes to what is important. And they can, if they really want to read it word for word, they can. But I'm just giving them the quick, like, "Hey, here's the full message, but here are like three or four annotation points that I'm either highlighting or pointing out with arrows." Key things to notice in the response.

## Template And Inputs For Implementation

[00:42:56]
**Bradley:**
You don't need to overanalyze every word. Right? Just look at these three or four things. So those are the two ways I can improve my readers' comprehension and also the speed of their comprehension, too. So the clarity and the speed of their comprehension of my screenshot examples. Okay.

## Providing Necessary Inputs For The Template

[00:43:26]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Next main subject point. So the template. I'll insert my custom instructions, like the code block content to just copy and paste. Cool.

[00:43:35]
**Bradley:**
Question is, what are the inputs my reader needs to implement this template? For example, content variables, device considerations, resource requirements, character limit constraints. I mean, I would just add like a bulleted list of. "Hey, to use this template, like, I don't know, number 1, you can do it on your iPhone or your laptop either way, but, like, doesn't matter. I would suggest typing it in the actual box, like the custom instructions box."

## Guidelines And Pro Tips For Success

[00:44:11]
**Bradley:**
"That way you can see the character limit in real time. Point out, hey, there is a character limit. Just like some pro tips." Basically like a bulleted list of my guidelines or pro tips, either right above or right below the template code block. We'll figure that out.

## Implementing The Yin Yang Prompting Technique

[00:44:29]
**Bradley:**
Okay. Okay, next question. What is the Yin Yang prompting technique, and how should my reader implement it here? Okay, I've described this a lot before. You just basically, especially this applies more so when you're defining personality attributes or sometimes interaction style things, like communication style things.

## Balancing Traits For Effective AI Communication

[00:44:49]
**Bradley:**
But think about what are some traits or characteristics or attributes, personality attributes that you want your AI friend to have. Okay, like, I don't know, do you want them to be introspective or you probably want them to be collaborative, right? Do you want them to challenge your thinking, whatever it is, right? And these are personality attributes and also interaction style attributes, I guess you could say. And you just want to balance them out, right?

## Striking The Right Balance To Avoid Overcorrection

[00:45:27]
**Bradley:**
So instead of overcorrecting or overfitting, you say, "Okay, I want you to be collaborative, but I also want you to be an independent thinker. Don't just take what I say at face value. I want you to think through these things yourself." Right? Those are just, again, balancing traits because you want to hit the sweet spot.

## Achieving The Sweet Spot In AI Interaction

[00:45:47]
**Bradley:**
There's a really good quote somewhere. I don't know if it's in a voice note, but it talks about the sweet spot. Maybe it's in my notion page where I guided Lara through these custom instructions. I don't know, talks about, like, you need to balance. Balance Bob sits.

## Making The Process Easy And Convenient

[00:46:03]
**Bradley:**
Because that's how you hit the sweet spot, which is exactly where you want to be. Something like that. Right. And that just really prevents the AI from overcorrecting and it just gives you a much more balanced identity and personality and interaction style. It's just much better.

## Trivializing The Application Process

[00:46:20]
**Bradley:**
Next question. How long does this take to apply in real life? And how can I make it sound easy and convenient to the point where it's trivial, meaning my reader has no excuses not to take action on it right now? I think just put a time estimate, like estimated time to complete five minutes. Right?

## Setting Expectations For The Process

[00:46:39]
**Bradley:**
Something like that. Kind of. Somewhere again, in the same list that you put the guidelines or instructions, guidelines and pro tips either above or below the template code block. I'd put like a kind of like a lot of articles have like estimated reading time. Right?

## Recap And Progress Checkpoints

[00:46:57]
**Bradley:**
Just estimated time to complete or to apply. 5 minutes or however long it takes. Okay, next main sub point is the recap question. What are the progress checkpoints my reader has hit by this point? What have they learned plus done by now?

## Highlighting Achievements And Progress Made

[00:47:16]
**Bradley:**
Again, I think just. I'm not going to get into this here, but I would give like three or four really simple and concise bullet points that feel like, you know, some sort of progress has been made. They had. They came into it without having something and now they do have something. So it's kind of like, it's kind of like Cole's thing that he always says where you're like, "I'm not going to guarantee you a conversion rate on your educational email course, but it's more like, hey, here's the guarantee."

## Setting Up For Success In The Next Email

[00:47:47]
**Bradley:**
"You didn't have it and now you do." Right? So it's just here are things that you didn't have before reading and applying this article or before reading and applying this email. And now here are the things you do have, right? Boom.

## Previewing The Next Steps And Email Content

[00:48:04]
**Bradley:**
Easy money.

[00:48:08]
**Bradley:**
Next question. Why should they feel proud of this progress and how is it going to set them up for success in the next email?

## Transitioning To The Next Email Topic

[00:48:20]
**Bradley:**
Let's see. I'm trying to think what the next email is.

## Preparing For Day Two: Mistake Number Two

[00:48:32]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. What is the next email? I think day 2 is there.

[00:49:32]
**Bradley:**
Okay, finally found it. So. Gosh, not the. Sorry, I need. I need the outline. Gosh dang it.

## Addressing Mistake Number Two: Communication Modes

[00:49:45]
**Bradley:**
Okay, so the day 2 email is mistake number 2. Blindly using the same communication mode for every conversation. When your AI offers three natural ways to talk, which the negative outcome of that is your creative flow dies because you're stuck typing with your fingers when you should be conversationally thinking out loud.

## Setting Up For Success In The Next Email

[00:50:07]
**Bradley:**
Yeah, so, I mean, so how does. How does day one's email basically set you up for success? Like, how does that progress set you up for success for day 2's email?

## Exploring Different Communication Modes

[00:50:23]
**Bradley:**
Because day two's email I'm really going to get into like using, right? You can either type with your fingers, like copy and paste text, whatever, or you can use advanced voice mode, or you can use the whisper transcription, like basically the voice to text.

## Importance Of Choosing A Voice For AI

[00:50:45]
**Bradley:**
Let's see. I don't know, man. I mean, I think it's just like again, one thing I forgot to include is when you set up your custom instructions in the day 1 email, you should also choose a voice, right? There's camera, there's like nine different voice options. So you should choose a voice.

## Preparing For Natural Conversations

[00:51:04]
**Bradley:**
Let me just put that. I totally forgot, but that should definitely be included somewhere in the action steps or the template. I don't know, whatever. So, yeah, I mean, this basically just sets you up to have really natural conversations with your AI friend. Regardless of if you're really typing on your laptop at your desk or having a conversation in your car out loud, like thinking out loud and braindumping, like whatever sort of communication mode you want to use is going to feel a lot more natural because you're interacting now with this personal AI friend that is your collaborative partner and it just feels much more natural.

## Conclusion And Next Steps

[00:51:59]
**Bradley:**
Right? So that naturally gives you a much better like basically AI person to communicate with in three natural ways that I will teach you in the next email. Something like that. Okay, let's see. Okay, cool.

## Preparing For Day Two And Future Iterations

[00:52:33]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. So and then the very last section is the conclusion, which is basically like, "Remember, don't forget to check your inbox tomorrow." Da da da da. And the two questions are, first off, what are the next steps my readers should take? And then the second question is, what does the next email's preview look like?

## Encouraging Continuous Iteration And Experimentation

[00:52:50]
**Bradley:**
Basically tomorrow's golden nuggets, right? Yeah. I mean, look, next steps is really just remember that you are always going to iterate on and refine your custom instructions, your AI's personality and identity and all that kind of stuff. And you're going to improve your prompting skills by approaching this like a scientist instead of whatever else. Like you're going to approach this like a scientist.

## Iterating And Evolving Over Time

[00:53:19]
**Bradley:**
You're going to experiment, you're going to have fun. You're constantly going to iterate and refine and evolve and get better. I think that's just something to expect going forward, and that's the next step. Expect that you're going to iterate on this for the next, you know, three to four weeks for sure. And even like the next six months and beyond, I'm still iterating on this and I've been using ChatGPT since the week it came out.

## Looking Ahead To Tomorrow's Content

[00:53:47]
**Bradley:**
Right.

[00:53:50]
**Bradley:**
Yeah. And then tomorrow's email, I think I'm. I'll answer that more a little bit later. But yeah, again, the three communication modes. Yeah, I'll.

## Following Structured Guidance For The Conclusion

[00:54:01]
**Bradley:**
I'll answer that a little bit more in depth later. I can't even remember what the content is exactly for that. So, yeah, and I think I'm just going to follow Cole's. Cole's basically instructions here. It's really again, Nicolas Cole, C O L E Cole.

## Finalizing The Email And Signing Off

[00:54:19]
**Bradley:**
It really should be pretty straightforward. Like, I don't think I'm going to be riffing too much or going off script too much in this last conclusion section. I think I'm really going to follow Cole's module three instructions pretty much like verbatim almost exactly. So if anything's needed, I'll add more context or content here later. All right.

## Personalizing The Sign-Off

[00:54:46]
**Bradley:**
And then you have the sign-off at the very end. I'm debating whether I should add my. Add my nickname. But whatever. Peace.

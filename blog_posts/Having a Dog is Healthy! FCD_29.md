### Pet lovers already know how amazing it is to have furry friends to cuddle with and live life with, am I right? They are just good for the soul! 

  

### Here are just a few of the reasons why having a dog (or kitty cat - we can show the feline folks some love)  is part of a life well-lived.

Pups provide unconditional love. All of us on planet Earth want to be loved and appreciated, and a dog can do just that. They are always excited to see you, don’t hold a grudge, and are more than willing to give hugs and kisses!

  

They are great listeners. Dogs are fantastic to share feelings of joy or sorrow with. You can tell them anything, and they never gossip or tell secrets!

Many dogs can pick up on your state of mind, whether you are sad or happy or angry, and will act accordingly. Several FADA families have reported their Aussiedoodles picking up on their sadness and how the pup will provide extra comfort by cuddling extra close during those times.

They help keep us active. Pups keep us busy with walks, fetch, and playing, which helps keep our hearts and blood pressure healthy. According to an article by the American Kennel Club, a comprehensive review of studies published between 1950 and 2019 found that dog owners had a lower risk of death. Studies suggest that dog owners have lower blood pressure levels and improved responses to stress. Research has concluded that the bond between humans and dogs reduces stress, which is a major cause of cardiovascular problems.

Dogs help us feel playful and youthful! Their happiness and goofball antics keep us laughing and feeling young.

  

Multiple studies show that dogs and therapy dogs help relieve stress and anxiety. Studies have shown petting a dog can reduce heart rate, breath rate, and stress (cortisol) hormone levels.

  

Send feelings of loneliness packing. First, the companionship and faithfulness of your beloved canine will reduce feelings of loneliness. Second, researchers have also found that about 40% of dog owners had an easier time making friends. When walking or hiking or visiting dog parks, stores, etc., people are more comfortable approaching people with dogs. It’s a great way to meet new people!

  

### Clearly, having a dog is healthy! These are just a few ways dogs and humans make the perfect team. How has your dog affected your life?

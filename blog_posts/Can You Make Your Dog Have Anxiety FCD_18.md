Yes! As loving pet parents, we can give our beloved pets anxiety and not even realize it. Folks tend to stay at home a lot more now. Some are retired, and others may work from home. And, when we venture from the house, oftentimes, we take the dog with us. It’s fabulous that so many places are dog-friendly now!

  

So, we tend to keep our dogs right by our sides at all hours of the day and night, and when we have to leave the dog at the house alone for a doctor's appointment, the dog is entirely out of sorts and has a fit. You’ll likely come home to chewed-up clothes, the trash can raided, or potty accidents strewn across the living room floor.

  

Why? Because you haven’t trained your dog to be independent and secure while you are away.

  

How do you teach your puppy to behave and feel safe while you’re gone?

  

### Crate training.

As many of you know, I’m a huge proponent of crate training. It is so important for the first six to nine months of your puppy’s life. Raising a puppy can be a challenge for the whole family, and by crate training the pup, you can ease some of that stress.

  

One, the crate provides a safe place for them to rest and stay out of trouble. Two, a crate helps them learn healthy boundaries and manners, like not using the bathroom in the house. Third, you and your dog need to be able to have a break from each other. You need to understand that it is okay for your dog to be alone, and your dog needs to know he can be alone. Everyone needs quiet time.

  

We want the puppy process to be a success and want you all to have the best experience possible with your new Aussiedoodle. Crate training doesn’t have to be a permanent thing, though. After nine months to a year old, if the dog is well-behaved and doesn’t make a mess when left alone in the house, feel free to wean them off the crate if that is your desire.

  

I will always recommend having a crate handy because it can be a lifesaver when traveling, when canine or human guests come over, during disasters, or while house repairs are being made. Having a crate and knowing your dog likes it is very reassuring and can actually help with your anxiety levels, too, as you go about this rollercoaster called life.

  

So when Aunt Susie comes over with a toddler who chases your pup all around the house to yank on his tiny tail, you can easily place your pup in a safe place where he is protected. In these situations, it’s always best to err on the side of caution. After all, we want to foster good family experiences for the household's humans and animals.

  

Have you crate-trained any dogs before? How did it help your life?

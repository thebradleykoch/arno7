When Is The Right Time To Own A Puppy?

  

## Sharing your life with an Aussiedoodle is a rewarding experience

You and your family will have the honor of caring for a sweet, energetic furry ball of love. And, the puppy will enrich your life with complete devotion, unconditional acceptance, and a lot of laughs.

  

Owning a dog is a big responsibility, though. How do you decide when the time is right to bring a mini Aussiedoodle or any dog into your home? And, once the decision is made, how do you prepare for your new best friend?

  

## Deciding to Get a Puppy

There are several things to consider before bringing a puppy home.

First of all, do the other people living with you want to have a dog? Be sure to talk it over with everyone who will play a part in the pup's life. Everyone must be on board and understand the commitment.

  

Second, think about timing. Do you have a big event coming up? Getting married? Moving? Starting a new job? Pregnant? Getting a divorce? If so, now is not the time for a new pet. Wait until life settles down and you have time and energy to devote to your Aussiedoodle. Dogs, especially puppies, demand a lot of time and attention.

  

Another thing to consider is how long you will leave the pup home alone. If you have long working or school hours, do you have someone to visit with your pup? Is there a doggie daycare nearby? A puppy or young dog can't be left alone for too long. They'll have to use the bathroom often and will get bored, which means chewing your favorite pair of shoes or your couch.

  

## Can you afford the pup?

Be sure you can pay for adequate food, shelter, training, vet care, toys, and more. Will you be crate training your puppy? If so, you'll need to purchase the right sized crate and have a place in the house to put it. Assess your backyard. Do you need a fence? If you don't have a backyard, is there a safe place to walk your dog regularly at various times of the day and night?

  

Is anyone in the house allergic to dogs? Are you okay with dog hair? Luckily, Aussiedoodles tend to be hypoallergenic, don't shed much, and are easy to groom. That's one thing that makes them so great!

  

Do you have time to play with and train your puppy? How active are you? Will you be hiking or camping or traveling with dogs? If so, a mini Aussiedoodle may fit right in. They love to be active with you! Your new best friend would love to go on a hike.

  

## Prepping Your Home For a Puppy

Once you've decided to purchase a puppy, now's the time to prepare for them to come home.

  

Talk about how to take care of a puppy with your family. Establish house rules and work toward consistency in applying those rules. For instance, will the pup be allowed on the couch? If not, make sure everyone follows through with that rule. Other standard house rules include no feeding from the table and no jumping on people. Your pup will learn, but it takes time and consistency.

  

Puppy proof the house. Walk around the house looking for potentially dangerous areas like hanging cords, glass vases on a coffee table, easy access to medications or cleaning supplies.

  

Also, assess the backyard. Are there poisonous plants or overgrown shrubs that could harbor ticks? How about holes in the fence? Are there pesticides within easy reach? Generally, you want to make sure the pup's living space is safe for them.

  

If you have children, consider making a checklist of scheduled feedings, walks, and potty breaks so everyone is on the same page and can help take care of the new pup.

  

Buy supplies like food and water bowls, leashes, collars, harnesses, food, brushes, beds, a crate, and toys. Shopping for all these items is super fun!

  

Call your vet and make an appointment for puppy vaccinations. Your pup should not visit any dog parks or shops until they have had all the required shots.

  

## Have fun and play!

Go for a hike or a walk. Go camping or travel with your pup. Play fetch. Roll on the floor. Pet their belly. Love on each other! Go to obedience training or work with them at home. To your dog, this is fun, and it helps keep their mind active and busy. Of course, to keep it fun, be sure to use positive reinforcement rather than punishment. Training enables you to develop a strong bond with your beloved puppy.

  

Whew, owning a dog is a huge responsibility! But, it's also one of life's most rewarding experiences. With time, patience, consistency, and love, you and your Aussiedoodle will develop a healthy relationship.

# 3 Little-Known Benefits Of Buying A Toddler Dog (4 Months & Older) vs A Puppy (4 Months & Younger)

**By Laney Wilks**

When it comes to finding your perfect dog, the youngest & cutest puppy in the litter might not actually be your best match.

As the owner of Fine & Dandy Dogs, I've spent the last 7+ years guiding families through the joys (and challenges) of dog ownership, from those first puppy days to the settled adult years. And let me tell you, I've heard these questions more times than I can count:

-   **"Won't I miss out on the 'cute puppy stage' if I get a toddler dog?"**
    
-   **"Shouldn't I get a puppy that's young enough to bond with me?"**
    
-   **"Are older puppies just the ones nobody wanted?"**

And I get why people think this way. Tiny puppies are cute as heck.

But here's the thing — those common beliefs? They're not quite right. A toddler dog might actually be perfect for you, even if you don't know it just yet.

Here are 3 benefits of buying a toddler dog most people don't realize (that might just change your mind about puppies altogether).

## Benefit [#1](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/1): You get to skip the toughest puppy stages.

Many new dog owners underestimate just how much work those first few months with a puppy can be.

You can feel jolted into some seriously stressful weeks, even having some regrets early on.

If you really want a puppy, be prepared for the full experience:

-   **The "24/7 Potty Party" phase:** Puppies need to go potty ALL day and ALL night. But toddlers? They can handle their business on their own (without you stepping in it).
    
-   **The "Chew Toy Takeover" phase:** Puppies explore the world with their mouths, which means your favorite shoes might become their new chew toys. Toddlers are usually past this stage and know what's okay to chew on (and what's not).
    
-   **The "Sleepless Nights" phase:** If you don't have a white noise machine, good luck getting any sleep with a puppy crying in the house. On the flip side, toddlers sleep more peacefully and reliably — which means you get the Zzzs you deserve too.
    
-   **The "Full-Time Babysitter" phase:** Puppies need to be supervised 24/7 to keep them safe and out of trouble. Toddlers are more independent and can entertain themselves while you take a much-needed break.
    

Bringing home a toddler is like a shortcut to the front of the line: you get to jump straight into the fun parts of having a dog (without the "Oh my gosh... what have I done??" moments of raising a puppy).

I've had dozens of people tell me how relieved they are to skip those super early stages. No more middle-of-the-night potty breaks or finding another chewed-up pair of your favorite shoes.

With a toddler dog, you get to enjoy hanging out with your new best friend without all the crazy puppy chaos.

But skipping the tough puppy stage is just the first huge benefit.

One of the coolest perks of getting a toddler? The things they start learning from you...

## Benefit [#2](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/2): Training a toddler is 2x easier & faster (even fun).

A lot of people think younger puppies are easier to train. But that's not always true.

This misconception can lead to real headaches when you start trying to train your pup for the first time. When you see the contrast between puppies and toddlers' training skills, it's a night & day difference. And that's because:

-   At Fine & Dandy, we've been training our toddlers every day for *months* already. It's kind of like boarding school (a fun version). So by the time you pick them up? They're ready to go, primed & pre-trained *before* they arrive home.
    
-   Toddlers can generally hold their bladder and bowels longer, which means you can skip the "puddles on the floor" phase. So now you can enjoy teaching your dog cool tricks — instead of teaching them how to pee. If you are consistent in showing them where you want this event to take place, they pick up on it quickly.
    
-   Toddlers have a head start on socialization and basic training. Their brains are like little sponges, making them more focused and confident than younger puppies. Less distraction means faster progress for you.
    
-   Toddlers have a better understanding of routine and structure, thanks to their time "in school" with us. This makes training feel more like a fun game than a frustrating chore.
    

Over the years, I've seen tons of people surprised at how fast their toddlers learn. They often pick up basic commands like "sit" and "stay" in just a couple of days.

It's not magic — it's just that their slightly older brains are ready to learn and adapt.

Going for a toddler dog can double the speed of your progress in training... and cut your stress level in half.

Now, tricks & treats are fun, but there's a unique personal benefit to choosing your own toddler dog (that most people aren't aware of)...

## Benefit [#3](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/3): What you see is what you get.

First-time dog owners often worry they'll miss out on shaping their dog's personality if they don't get a brand-spanking-new puppy.

But falling for this mindset can actually cause you to overlook the pup who'll be your soul mate.

So here are some helpful things to be aware of:

-   Toddler dogs show more of their true personality at their age than puppies do. What you see is what you get, which makes finding your perfect match a lot easier.
    
-   With a toddler, you can see how they interact with other dogs, how they handle new situations, and what their energy level is like. This gives you a much clearer picture of how they'll fit into your life.
    
-   Toddlers have had time to develop their unique quirks and characteristics. You can get a sense of whether they're more of a snuggle bug or an adventurer, a couch potato or a social butterfly.
    
-   While puppies are adorable, they're also unpredictable. Their personalities can change quite a bit as they grow up. With a toddler, you have a much better idea of who they are and who they're likely to become.
    

Time after time, I've seen so many families thrilled with their toddler dogs. They come back months or even years later, and their dog's personality is exactly the same as the day they first met.

Because at 4–6 months old, a dog's character usually sticks around. And that makes choosing a pup with a disposition that clicks with yours so much easier.

## Bottom Line

At the end of the day, toddler dogs are a perfect blend: playful puppy energy meets grown-up dog chill.

Toddlers aren't "leftovers" or less affectionate than younger puppies, like some people have been led to believe. They're actually just really great dogs waiting for the right family. So if you're new to dogs, have a busy life, or just want an easier start, a toddler dog might be a perfect match for you.

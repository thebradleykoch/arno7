# Big Plans In Store for 2024!

### Goodbye 2023, and Hello 2024! Fine and Dandy Aussiedoodles has big plans in store for 2024, and you won’t want to miss a minute of it.

Before we get to the big news, I want to thank all the Fine and Dandy folks who follow me on Instagram, Facebook, or the website. Your support means so much to me!

  

I love building relationships online, and it’s like friends being reunited when we finally meet IRL (in real life). Recently, a couple who have been active followers on Instagram for two years decided it was the right time for their family to add a puppy. They submitted their application and came for a visit. There were hugs to go around, and we all had a great time. 

  

I’m thankful they and others trust me to provide accurate, quality, heartfelt guidance about their current and future pets. It’s a responsibility I don’t take lightly. I’m blessed to have a positive online community supporting me and my business. Thank you for all the positive comments, referrals, and recommendations. You all do my heart good, and I look forward to serving you all in 2024 and beyond.  :-)

  

### Drum roll, please......

I am expanding the Fine and Dandy breeding program! Yes, you heard that right. Together with my staff, we’ll add other breeds to our stellar, high-quality program. 

  

Our Fine and Dandy Mini Aussiedoodles have been the focus for the past several years, and it’s going so well that we feel it’s time to apply our expertise to Moyen Poodles. 

  

The adorable yet versatile Mini Aussiedoodle is 50% Moyen Poodle and 50% Mini Aussie, so it’s only natural to breed them individually. We will reserve certain ones for our breeding program and offer the majority to our amazing FADA family of pet parents.

  

Moyen, or Klein, Poodles are medium-sized poodles that have been almost unseen since the 1960s. For some reason, this particular size of Poodle faded away and has only recently started to see a comeback due to its perfect size and versatility. These dogs range from 25 to 32 pounds, have sturdy, solid bodies, and are very smart. They are both cuddly lapdogs and rough-and-tumble outdoor companions. Moyen Poodles can keep up with the most popular outdoor/active dogs today.

  

These Poodles will have AKC registrations and be available with or without breeding rights.

### But WAIT, there’s more!

  

We also plan to introduce a new Doodle breed!! This super exciting addition to the Fine and Dandy family of dogs will be something other than a commonly found Doodle. It will be medium-sized and will have the ability to be a cuddle companion and an outdoor go-getter! We hope to have the breeds selected in the next six months or so.

  

We will continue carefully and thoughtfully breeding medium-sized dogs that are happy, healthy, active members of their forever families. I am excited to serve the Fine and Dandy community in 2024. Be sure to stay tuned to our blog and our Instagram!

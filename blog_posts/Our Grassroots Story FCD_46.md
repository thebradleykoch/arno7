# Our Grassroots Story

Fine and Dandy Aussiedoodles has experienced remarkable grassroots growth since our inception. We are proud to have our pups in ten states throughout the United States, and we look forward to expanding nationally as word of our fabulous dogs continues to spread.

  

To date, our specially bred mini Aussiedoodles call Ohio, Massachusets, Utah, Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Maine, New Mexico, Washington DC, and all parts of California home. More sweet pups will stake their claim on more states as folks on the puppy waiting list receive their new family members.

  

When I know my dogs are the center of attention and become a beloved family member, I feel I have done my job correctly. Breeding two of the smartest dogs together, an Australian Shepherd and a Poodle, creates an excellent, well-rounded companion who can indeed do it allâ€”while looking great too! The responsibility of matching each pup to an approved family is an honor and a responsibility we don't take lightly.

  

People and families interested in one of our pups undergo an application process based on many factors, including home environment, level of commitment, family budget, experience with dogs, and more. We know having a fur-kid can impact the pocketbook, and sometimes life throws us curveballs, so please know we can talk about what you're going through and see if anything can be done to help. We also enjoy meeting prospective pet-parents, whether in person, online, or over the phone.

### Well, it’s almost March, and 2024 has already proven to be a whirlwind of a year! Life can be a roller coaster of emotions and experiences in this wonderful thing called life. Wonderful ones, horrible ones, and meh ones all combine to create an elaborate tapestry of our individual lives.

  

Each of our life tapestries will have common threads with the people we have relationships with, and I’m so completely grateful for the common thread that Fine and Dandy Aussiedoodles has allowed me to weave with the FADA family, from established pet parents to new friends on social media.

  

Through these cuddly bundles of puppy joy, I’ve developed sweet, long-lasting relationships, and I love knowing that if and when times get hard, I have several people in multiple states that I can count on.

  

Some friends have gotten to know me so well that they can tell if I'm having a great day or a bad day. These great people will reach out and check on me to just make sure I'm doing <u style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>okay.</span></u> [<u style="text-decoration: underline;"><span> It</span></u>](http://okay.it)'s so nice to know that I have an open invitation to visit many people in different states and there's always room for me to stay at their house.

  

It's such a an honor to have many heart felt invitations to come stay in my family's homes.

  

## So, thank you so much for your time, support, and friendship! I don’t know what I’d do without you!

  

Another thing I don’t know what I’d do without is the unconditional love of a dog. They offer so much happiness and affection. Several FADA family members have noticed how intuitive Fine and Dandy Aussiedoodle are. They are scary good at sensing emotion and adapting to what their people need.

One pet parent, Lauren, says that her pup Blue can tell when she’s sad or upset, and he’ll lay on her. One day, he just draped himself over her shoulder upside down and lay there for a long time. The goofiness of the position and the warmth of his little furry body was just what she needed!

  

My dog, Autumn, sensed I was upset just the other day and abandoned her usual sleep spot to cuddle up to me during the night. 

  

Dogs are such amazing creatures, and they can help us cope with everyday life by providing comfort, trust, loyalty, laughter, and pure love. They are always there to willingly go along with anything and everything - from dancing happily in the kitchen to down times on the couch.

  

I highly recommend living life with a dog or four! ;-)

  

## Thank you again to all of the FADA friends out there, and thank you to all of the faithful canine companions out there who take care of us humans.

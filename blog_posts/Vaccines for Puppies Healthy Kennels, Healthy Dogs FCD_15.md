# Vaccines for Puppies: Healthy Kennels, Healthy Dogs

If youâ€™ve been following me for any length of time, youâ€™ve probably noticed that Iâ€™m a bit of a clean freak. My team and I do work very hard to keep this Fine and Dandy place spic-and-span! ðŸ™‚

  

Itâ€™s not all because I like things tidy, though. Itâ€™s because cleanliness equals healthiness. Clean kennels mean healthy kennels and healthy kennels equal healthy dogs.

  

Our Fine and Dandy dogs and puppies are not just cute; they're also well taken care of. They receive regular medical care, including regular deworming. This is because some parasites can travel through the motherâ€™s milk to the pups, posing a health risk. So, we deworm the momma dogs and the puppies, ensuring their health and well-being.

  

Puppies who are under five weeks old only receive the dewormer Pyrantel.

  

When puppies reach five weeks old, they receive an immunity booster called Neopar in addition to the dewormer. Neopar helps the puppy sustain a stronger immunity system and provides a great foundation for subsequent vaccines. This practice produces strong, healthy litters!

At eight weeks old, puppies receive the Canine 1-DAPPv+Cv vaccine. This immunization provides protection against viruses like canine distemper, adenovirus (hepatitis and respiratory), parainfluenza, parvovirus, and coronavirus. This is the first shot of a three-shot series they will need to continue (at 12 weeks and 16 weeks) once they go home with their new parents.

  

These injections can be given either intramuscularly (into the muscle) or subcutaneously (under the skin). I give all injections subcutaneously and leave the intramuscular to the veterinarians.Â 

  

Each dog has a file saying who he or she belongs to, what she received, and when she received it, plus general information for puppy care to help make the transition into your home as smooth as possible.

I hear from folks every day who are excited about Aussie Doodles but aren't sure if they're the right fit. As someone who's been working with these amazing dogs for years, I've seen it all. And I'm here to give you straight answers to the questions you should consider before getting one.

  

By the end of this post, you'll have a clear picture of what to expect with an Aussie Doodle — and you'll know if this breed is the perfect match for your family and lifestyle.

  

## Question [#1](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/1): "Is there a personality difference between boys and girls?"

  

Many people ask me if they should get a boy or a girl Aussie Doodle. They're often surprised by my answer.

  

In my experience, personality in Aussie Doodles isn't about boy or girl. It's about the individual pup.

  

Here's what really shapes an Aussie Doodle's personality:

  

-   How they're raised and socialized
    
-   Whether they're spayed / neutered or intact
    
-   The mix of Poodle and Australian Shepherd traits they inherit
    

  

If you want a cuddly, Velcro dog, look for puppies with more Poodle traits. They'll stick to you like glue.

If you prefer a dog that's attentive but independent, choose a pup with more Australian Shepherd traits. They'll keep an eye on you but won't be in your lap 24/7.

  

Remember, these traits show up in both boys and girls. I've got several girls at home, and they all have different personalities.

  

So don't get hung up on boy or girl. Focus on finding a pup whose personality clicks with your family.

  

## Question [#2](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/2): "If I have an existing dog, what sex of dog will blend better?"

  

If you've already got a dog at home, you might be wondering if you should get a boy or girl Aussie Doodle to match.

  

Here's my recommendation based on years of experience (as well as input from my clients):

  

If you have a boy dog:

  

-   Either a boy or girl Aussie Doodle will usually be fine
    
-   They tend to get along well regardless of sex
    

  

If you have a girl dog:

  

-   A boy Aussie Doodle is often the best choice
    
-   2 girls can sometimes be more prone to squabbles
    

  

But remember, individual personalities matter more than sex. Here's what to consider:

  

-   Your existing dog's temperament (Are they easy-going or dominant?)
    
-   The age difference (An older dog might prefer a calmer puppy)
    
-   Your ability to manage and train multiple dogs
    

  

I've seen plenty of happy homes with 2 girls or 2 boys. It's all about how you introduce them and manage their relationship.

  

If you're not sure, talk to me about your specific situation. I can help you choose a pup that'll fit right in with your furry family.

## Question [#3](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/3): "How much time is required to raise a new puppy?"

  

New puppy owners often underestimate how much time their Aussie Doodle will need. Let me break it down for you.

  

For the first few months, plan on dedicating about 5 hours a day to your new puppy. Yep, you heard that right — 5 hours.

  

Here's how that time breaks down:

  

-   **Feeding:** 30 minutes (15 minutes, twice a day)
    
-   **Potty breaks:** Every 2 hours, plus right after meals
    
-   **Playtime:** 15-20 minute sessions, 3 times a day
    
-   **Training:** Short sessions throughout the day
    
-   **Walks:** Start with short walks, increasing as they grow
    

  

This might sound like a lot, but it's crucial for raising a well-adjusted Aussie Doodle.

  

If you work full-time, you'll need to make arrangements. Can you come home at lunch? Can a family member or dog walker help out? If not, an Aussie Doodle puppy might not be the right choice right now.

  

Remember, this intense time commitment doesn't last forever. As your pup grows, they'll need less constant supervision. But they'll always need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation.

  

## Question [#4](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/4): "Is my dog crate trained already?"

  

When you get your Aussie Doodle puppy from me, they'll have a head start on crate training. But they won't be fully trained yet.

  

Here's what to expect:

  

-   Your puppy will be introduced to a crate at 5 weeks old
    
-   By 7 weeks, they'll be sleeping alone in a crate at night
    
-   They'll be used to the crate as a safe space
    

  

But here's the catch — they need to learn that their crate at your home is safe too.

  

To make the transition smooth:

  

1.  Keep the crate in a quiet, low-traffic area
    
2.  Put a familiar blanket or toy in the crate
    
3.  Never use the crate as punishment
    

  

Expect some whining at first. It's normal. If your pup cries, try sitting near the crate and offering comfort without letting them out.

And above all? Stick with it. A well crate-trained Aussie Doodle is a joy to live with and travel with.

## Question [#5](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/5): "Will my puppy be potty trained when I get them?"

  

I'll be honest with you — your Aussie Doodle puppy won't be fully potty trained when you bring them home. But they'll have a good start.

  

Here's what to expect:

  

-   Your puppy will be used to a potty schedule
    
-   They'll understand the concept of going potty in a specific area
    
-   But they won't know where to go in your home yet
    

  

To build on this foundation:

  

1.  Take your puppy out every 2 hours, plus after meals and naps (this will help them establish a habit).
    
2.  Use the same command each time (like "go potty").
    
3.  Praise and reward when they go in the right spot.
    
4.  If your puppy has an accident after the first week home, lower your voice, show your dog the accident area, and use a verbal command each time (like "bad potty"). Then pick your dog up and show them where they're supposed to go.
    

  

Expect accidents for the first few weeks. It's part of the process.

  

If you're consistent, most Aussie Doodles are reliably potty trained by 4-5 months old.

  

Remember, smaller dogs have smaller bladders. Be patient and stick to the schedule.

  

## Wrapping Up

  

Bringing an Aussie Doodle into your life is a big commitment, but it's also incredibly rewarding. They're smart, loving, and full of personality.

  

If you can commit the time to training, exercise, and socialization, an Aussie Doodle can be an amazing addition to your family.

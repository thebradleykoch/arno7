# What is the Typical Puppy Routine?

### Wondering about the typical daily routine of our puppies? Many pet-parents-to-be ask us about the routine their pups are used to so they can try to stick to it for a little while. This can help ease the transition into your home. However, please know this is what works for us and the environment we have here at Fine and Dandy. At your home, with your unique routines, please feel free to create the schedule that works best for you, your family, and your puppy.

Additionally, for the first ten days or so that the puppy is home with you, expect to take him or her out frequently, even more than what is listed below. Pick them up and carry them outside to your preferred potty area. If you are holding them, they are less likely to relieve themselves on their way outside.  

### Here is the general puppy routine we follow here at Fine and Dandy.

-   Awake 7 to 7:30 a.m.
    
-   Potty time - we carry the puppies out to the potty spot
    
-   Breakfast
    
-   Potty again
    
-   Playtime - this is a good time to train and work with him
    
-   11 a.m. to 12 nap time for 1 to 2 hours, depending on when the puppy wakes up
    
-   Potty time
    
-   Snack time - We offer a little snack of food, but he may or may not choose to eat - up until 4 months of age
    
-   Playpen or yard time until 5 p.m.
    
-   Dinner
    
-   Potty
    
-   More playtime and interaction time - great training opportunity to learn his name and other fun stuff
    
-   Take potty again (notice a pattern here? Lots of pottying going on!)
    
-   Bedtime is 9 p.m. (Need tips? [<u style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>This blog on Crate Training will help.</span></u>](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/post/let-s-talk-crate-training))
    

Roughly, the puppies wake up around 7:30 a.m. They then go out to go potty, followed by time in a playpen and breakfast time. Food is available for about 45 minutes for plenty of time to eat. (A note about eating - do not expect him to eat a lot during the first 48 hours of coming into your home. If that is the case, put the food out a few more times, giving him access while he gets used to you and his new surroundings.)

He then plays during the day and may take some little cat naps, but at 11 or 12 o'clock, it’s nap time. He is placed in a blanket-covered kennel and should sleep between 2 to 3 hours. As he gets older, his nap or rest time can easily be 3 hours without a problem.

Then, he plays with his mates in a pen area before having dinner, a potty break, and more playtime. What a life, huh?

The puppies are taken to the potty area before bed and then tucked into their crates, safe and sound for the night. The kennels are covered with blankets, and a sound machine and/or fan is used to cover up noises.

Using kennels here helps them transition to their kennel/crate at home. [<u style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Review this blog on Crate Training for more information on that.</span></u>](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/post/let-s-talk-crate-training)

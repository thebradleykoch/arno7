# The "Puppy Honeymoon Phase": 3 Bad Habits To Ditch In Your Dog's First Week Home (To Build Lasting Positive Behaviors)

**By Laney Wilks**

Bringing home a new puppy is exciting, but let me tell you — that first week can set the tone for your dog's behavior forever.

I've seen it time and time again with my Aussie Doodles that I place into their forever homes. New owners get caught up in the excitement and accidentally create bad behaviors during what I call the **"Puppy Honeymoon Phase"**. And these early missteps can lead to long-term behavioral issues that are tough to correct later.

But don't worry: I'm here to help. I've guided countless families through this transition, and I can show you what works.

Let's talk about the 3 most common bad habits to avoid in your puppy's first week home. Believe me, following these recommendations will make your transition into dog parenthood *so much smoother*.

## Bad Habit [#1](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/1): Giving Your Puppy Too Much Freedom Too Soon

I get it. You bring your new pup home and want them to explore every nook and cranny. It seems like the kind thing to do, right?

But here's the thing — puppies aren't ready for that much freedom right off the bat. It often leads to destructive behaviors and potty training nightmares. I've had clients call me in a panic because their pup has chewed up baseboards or peed all over mom's favorite rug.

**Instead, try this approach:**

-   Start small. Limit your dog to one puppy-proofed area at first.
    
-   As your pup learns the rules, gradually give them access to more of the house.
    
-   Use baby gates or closed doors to keep them out of areas they haven't earned yet.
    

**Think of it like this:** you're not restricting your pup, you're setting them up for success. They'll feel more secure in a smaller space, and you'll have an easier time supervising and redirecting any unwanted behaviors.

Now, let's talk about another common mistake that can throw your pup for a loop.

## Bad Habit [#2](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/2): Disrupting Your Puppy's Established Routines

When you first bring your puppy home, it's tempting to let them call the shots. They whine, you feed them. They look cute, you wake them up to play. But trust me, this approach can backfire fast.

Puppies thrive on routine. They come to you with certain habits already in place (feeding times, potty schedules, nap routines, and more). When we disrupt these routines, even with the best intentions, it can lead to a confused and anxious pup.

**Here's what I recommend:**

-   Stick to the feeding and potty schedule your puppy had before coming home.
    
-   Keep play sessions and nap times consistent.
    
-   Resist the urge to wake a sleeping puppy, no matter how cute they look.
    

I know it might seem rigid, but a consistent routine is actually comforting for your dog. It helps them understand what to expect and reduces stress. Plus, it makes training so much easier down the line.

Speaking of routines, let's tackle one of the biggest challenges new puppy owners face: kennel training.

## Bad Habit [#3](https://www.fineanddandyaussiedoodles.com/blog-1/hashtags/3): Mishandling Kennel Training

I hear it all the time: *"But Laney, isn't putting my puppy in a kennel cruel?"* I get where this concern comes from, but it couldn't be further from the truth.

When done right, a kennel becomes your puppy's safe space — their own little den. But if we approach it the wrong way, yeah, it can lead to a dog who hates their kennel and gets anxious whenever you leave.

**Here's how to make kennel training a positive experience:**

-   Introduce the kennel gradually, using treats and praise.
    
-   Never use the kennel as punishment.
    
-   If your pup whines or barks in the kennel, don't give in. It only teaches them that making noise gets them what they want.
    
-   Make the kennel inviting with a cozy blanket and a safe chew toy. This creates positive associations and gives your pup something to do while in there.
    

**Remember,** your puppy's kennel isn't a prison cell. It's a cozy retreat where they can rest and feel safe. When introduced correctly, most dogs actually love their kennels!

## Essential Takeaways

The habits you establish in the first week will shape your puppy's behavior for *years to come*. I can't stress this enough.

Start preparing now, before your puppy comes home:

1.  Set up a safe, limited area.
    
2.  Plan out a consistent routine.
    
3.  And introduce the kennel as a positive space from day one.

# 6 Fundamental Building Blocks Of Every Book, Course, And Digital Product I Create

**(TL;DR Version)**

1. **Thinking:** Every book, course, or digital product needs to start by introducing net-new thinking.

    - What's the new problem?
    - What's the old problem, reconsidered?
    - What's the unique & different POV?

2. **Emotion:** After new thinking is presented, the reader has lots of emotions swirling around inside them. You must speak to these emotions — so the reader knows you understand them.

    - "This is scary."
    - "Does this actually work?"
    - "This goes against what I believe in."

3. **Myths:** Before the reader can take Action Steps forward, they need to know where they went wrong (backward).

    - What faulty beliefs are still holding the reader back?
    - What does the reader think is true, that isn't?
    - What isn't the reader "seeing clearly"?

4. **Action Steps:** Only once the reader trusts you to take them in a new direction will they be ready to take action.

    - Step 1: Do this. For this reason. To unlock X.
    - Step 2: Do this. For this reason. To unlock Y.
    - Step 3: Do this. For this reason. To unlock Z.

5. **Examples:** Next, root your Action Steps in concrete examples.

    - Who took these steps and saw success?
    - What happens if someone DOESN'T take these steps?
    - What's the before / after transformation?

6. **Templates:** The last point of friction keeping people from taking action is: "I don't know where to start." Templates are like training wheels for learning, and allow them to color inside the lines while they put this new thinking into practice.

# The 6 Proven Content Sections For Every Book, Course, And Digital Product

**(Full-Length Version)**

By Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole

---

Ahoy and happy Monday!

Welcome to another week of Start Writing Online—where every week we dive into 1 of the 10 biggest problems all writers face:

- Distractions
- Over-editing
- Perfectionism
- Procrastination
- Self-confidence
- Generating ideas
- Imposter syndrome
- Writing consistently
- Finding time to write
- Loose feedback loops

(And, of course, if you want to crush all 10 of these AND master the fundamentals of Digital Writing in just 30 days, we'd love to have you in the next cohort of Ship 30 for 30!)

### This week, we want to help you write literally anything on the planet without ever feeling stuck again

You’re going to want to sit down because this framework will blow your mind.

Every single book, course, or digital product basically has the same 6 sections:

1. Thinking
2. Emotions
3. Myths
4. Action Steps
5. Examples
6. Templates

What is a book? A book is X chapters of these 6 sections.

What is a course? A course is X modules with these 6 sections.

What is a digital product? An eBook, or a mini-course, or a free/paid download, or a newsletter with these 6 sections.

These 6 sections are the fundamental building blocks of literally every single written product on planet earth. And if you understand how each one works, and the “role” it serves in your content, you will never experience Writer’s Block again.

The product will write itself.

So, let’s dig in!

## The Content Sections Stack

Here’s how each one of these sections works, when you should use it, and what value it provides to your reader.

### Section 1: Open With The “Thinking”

Every great book, course, or digital product opens with the “thinking,” first.

The writer and creator needs you to understand the new and different POV before she or he can give you action steps, templates, and a path forward. This is achieved by articulating:

1. Where you’re headed (your North Star)
2. Why it matters
3. The reward for reaching the other side

For example: books like *Think Again* by Adam Grant, or *Think and Grow Rich* by Napoleon Hill make the case for why you should “think differently.” Well, every great product benefits from having an opener that articulates some sort of new & differentiated thinking. That’s how you get your reader, listener, viewer, customer, or student to trust you on the journey forward.

You must present them with a new & different way forward.

### Section 2: Set The Emotional Context

What comes next is the Emotion.

This is how your reader, customer, or student then feels about this new path.

- What are the fears holding them back from wanting to move forward?
- What are their hopes, dreams, and ambitions that might inspire them to “take the leap?”
- What’s been getting in their way in the past—and how do they feel about it?
- How do they feel about themselves, right now, before they’ve begun their journey & successfully transformed?

The emotional component of your content is as valuable (sometimes even more valuable) than any of the action steps you provide. In fact, there are some writers and creators who launch entire products and courses where all they do is speak to the “emotional” obstacles holding their readers back.

It’s worth noting, however, that most writers & creators think of Emotions and Action Steps as completely different (you have “Motivational” content, and you have “How-To” content). In reality, How-To content benefits tremendously from Emotional Context, and Emotional Content benefits tremendously from How-To/Actionable Content.

Which is why it is such an important “section” to include in whatever it is you’re creating.

### Section 3: Debunk Myths

Next are the myths.

Your reader/customer/student has bought in to your new & different thinking, and they also feel emotionally understood because you have spoken to the underlying feelings that are currently swirling around inside of them.

The last section (before moving into Action Steps) is to help them understand where they went wrong in the past.

- What myths and “faulty beliefs” has your reader internalized that are no longer serving them?
- What myths about the industry is your reader still blindly believing?
- What myths are keeping your reader from being able to “see things clearly”?

Pointing out these “myths” helps your reader do a quick audit of their past and come to a conclusion as to where they went wrong—which is a crucial part of them fully buying into the journey ahead.

### Section 4: Provide Action Steps

All of this—Thinking, Emotion, and Myths—has to come first.

Only then is your reader, customer, or student ready to start putting things into action.

Action Steps are the ACTIONS your reader needs to take in order to facilitate a meaningful transformation in their life (AKA the desired transformation they’re looking for).

- **Step 1:** Do this. For this reason. To unlock X.
- **Step 2:** Now do this. For this reason. To unlock Y.
- **Step 3:** Finally, do this. For this reason. To unlock Z.

The problem with the type of content that is exclusively Thinking or Emotion-driven is that while it can be incredibly informative for your reader, it isn’t actionable. Your reader doesn’t know what to do with it. Similarly, content that is 100% Action-oriented might be helpful when put into practice, but unless your reader understands WHY it’s important, the likelihood of them following through is low.

The magic combination is facilitating understanding (Thinking, Emotion, Myths) and *then* pairing that understanding with Action Steps.

### Section 5: Offer Relatable Examples

The easiest way to make your Action Steps “stick,” however, is by rooting them in relatable examples.

- Who is someone else who took these same Action Steps and saw success?
- What happens if someone *doesn’t* take these Action Steps? What mistakes will they make?
- What are inspirational case studies that PROVE these Action Steps work?

Action Steps without examples make your reader question whether or not they are being given the right information. Whereas Action Steps with examples, case studies, “before & after” transformations, and “proven results” reinforce to your reader they are in the right place—and all they have to do is follow the instructions on the box.

### Section 6: Give Your Reader A Template

Of course, there is one last friction point keeping people from taking action.

They don’t know where to start.

Every new Action Step in life feels a bit like a blank canvas. Even with the most detailed instructions, forward movement is a bit like watching someone else paint a picture and then trying to do so yourself by memory. It’s very difficult.

The way you inspire readers, customers, and students to overcome the obstacle of “getting started” is by removing the “blank canvas” problem and giving them a template.

- “Here, color inside the lines.”
- “Here, fill this in.”
- “Here, just replace these words with your own.”

Giving a template removes the last excuse in your reader’s arsenal, which is, “I don’t know where to begin.”

Now, they do know where to start (and, like training wheels, they can gradually let go of relying on the template as their proficiency increases).

### Summary Of The “6 Content Sections”

When all is said and done, these 6 fundamental building blocks essentially outline the sections / modules of any book, course, or digital product:

1. Thinking
2. Emotions
3. Myths
4. Action Steps
5. Examples
6. Templates

And you can use this stack over and over again.

That's it for today, chat next week!
